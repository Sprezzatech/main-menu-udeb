   <title>Configuring apt</title>

<para>

The main means that people use to install packages on their system is
via a program called <command>apt-get</command>, from the
<classname>apt</classname> package.<footnote>

<para>

Note that the actual program that installs packages is called
<command>dpkg</command>.  However, this program is more of a low-level
tool.  <command>apt-get</command> is a higher-level tool as it will
invoke <command>dpkg</command> as appropriate and also because it knows
to install other packages which are required for the package you're
trying to install, as well as how to retrieve the package from your
CD, the network, or wherever.

</para>
</footnote>
Other front-ends for package management, like <command>aptitude</command>
and <command>synaptic</command> are also in use and depend on
<command>apt-get</command>. These front-ends are recommended for new users,
since they integrate some additional features (package searching and status checks)
in a nice user interface.

</para><para>

<command>apt</command> must be configured so that it knows where to retrieve
packages from. The installer largely takes care of this automatically based on
what it knows about your installation medium. The results of this configuration
are written to the file <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename>, and you can
examine and edit it to your liking after the install is complete.
