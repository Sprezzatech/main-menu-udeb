<para>

The installer might ask you if the computer's clock is set to UTC. Normally
this question is avoided if possible and the installer tries to work out
whether the clock is set to UTC based on things like what other operating
systems are installed.

In expert mode you will always be able to choose
whether or not the clock is set to UTC.
<phrase arch="m68k;powerpc">Macintosh hardware clocks are normally
set to local time. If you want to dual-boot, select local time instead of
GMT.</phrase>
<phrase arch="i386">Systems that (also) run Dos or Windows are normally
set to local time. If you want to dual-boot, select local time
instead of GMT.</phrase>

Note that the installer does not currently allow you to actually set the
time in the computer's clock. You can set the clock to the current time
after you have installed, if it is incorrect or if it was previously not
set to UTC.
