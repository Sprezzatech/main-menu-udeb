Most PCI and many older ISA network cards are supported.
Some network interface cards are not supported by most Debian
installation disks, such as AX.25 cards and protocols;
NI16510 EtherBlaster cards; Schneider &amp; Koch G16 cards;
and the Zenith Z-Note built-in network card. Microchannel (MCA) network
cards are not supported by the standard installation system, but see
<ulink url="&url-linux-mca;">Linux on MCA</ulink> for some (old)
instructions.
FDDI networks are also not supported by the installation disks, both
cards and protocols.

<!-- missing-doc FIXME You can create a custom kernel which supports an
otherwise unsupported card and then substitute in the installer (see
<xref linkend="rescue-replace-kernel"/>). -->

As for ISDN, the D-channel protocol for the (old) German 1TR6 is not
supported; Spellcaster BRI ISDN boards are also not supported by the
&d-i;.

Any network interface card (NIC) supported by the Linux kernel should
also be supported by the boot disks.  You may need to load your
network driver as a module.  Again, see
<ulink url="&url-m68k-faq;"></ulink> for complete details.

The following network interface cards are supported as modules.  They
can be enabled once the drivers are installed during the setup.
However, due to the magic of OpenPROM, you still should be able to
boot from these devices:

as modules so you need to load one first during the initial network

If your card is mentioned in the lists above, the complete installation
can be carried out from the network with no need for CD-ROMs or floppy
disks.

Any other network interface card (NIC) supported by the Linux kernel
should also be supported by the boot disks.  You may need to load your
network driver as a module; this means that you will have to install
the operating system kernel and modules using some other media.
