 <sect1 id="linuxdevices"><title>Linux Devices</title>
<para>

In Linux various special files can be found under the directory
<filename>/dev</filename>. These files are called device files and
behave unlike ordinary files. The most common types of device files
are for block devices and character devices. These files are an
interface to the actual driver (part of the Linux kernel) which in
turn accesses the hardware. Another, less common, type of device file
is the named <firstterm>pipe</firstterm>.
The most important device files are listed in the tables below.

  <title>Setting Up Your Mouse</title>
<para>

The mouse can be used in both the Linux console (with gpm) and the X
window environment. Normally, this is a simple matter of installing
<filename>gpm</filename> and the X server itself. Both should be
configured to use <filename>/dev/input/mice</filename> as the mouse
device. The correct mouse protocol is named <userinput>exps2</userinput>
in gpm, and <userinput>ExplorerPS/2</userinput> in X. The respective
configuration files are <filename>/etc/gpm.conf</filename> and
<filename>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</filename>.

</para><para>

Certain kernel modules must be loaded in order for your mouse to work.
In most cases the correct modules are autodetected, but not always for
old-style serial and bus mice<footnote>

<para>
Serial mice usually have a 9-hole D-shaped connector; bus mice have an
8-pin round connector, not to be confused with the 6-pin round connector
of a PS/2 mouse or the 4-pin round connector of an ADB mouse.

To load a mouse driver module, you can use the <command>modconf</command>
command (from the package with the same name) and look in the category
<userinput>kernel/drivers/input/mouse</userinput>.

Modern kernels give you the capability to emulate a three-button mouse
when your mouse only has one button. Just add the following lines to
<filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> file.

<informalexample><screen>
# 3-button mouse emulation
# turn on emulation
/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button_emulation = 1
# Send middle mouse button signal with the F11 key
/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button2_keycode = 87

/dev/mac_hid/mouse_button3_keycode = 88
# For different keys, use showkey to tell you what the code is.

 <title>Disk Space Needed for Tasks</title>

<!-- Note for d-i and manual maintainers
 Sizes of tasks should be determined by running tasksel with the "new-install"
 option on a system that been fully installed without selecting any tasks. By
 selecting a task together with the "manual selection" option, aptitude will
 be started and show the sizes for the task. Use "cancel pending actions" to
 clear the slate, quit aptitude and repeat for other tasks.
 Space requirements need to be determined from tasksel as tasksel will not
 install recommended packages while selecting a task from aptitude will.

 The size for the minimal base system should be determined after running
 'aptitude clean' using 'du -hsx /'. After that the "Standard system" task
 should be installed after which the size of the standard system should be
 determined using the same method.
-->

<para>

A standard installation for the i386 architecture, including all standard
packages and using the default 2.6 kernel, takes up 442MB of disk space.
A minimal base installation, without the <quote>Standard system</quote>
task selected, will take 230MB.

</para>
<important><para>

In both cases this is the actual disk space used <emphasis>after</emphasis>
the installation is finished and any temporary files deleted. It also does
not take into account overhead used by the file system, for example for
journal files. This means that significantly more disk space is needed both
<emphasis>during</emphasis> the installation and for normal system use.

</para></important>
<para>

The following table lists sizes reported by aptitude for the tasks listed
in tasksel. Note that some tasks have overlapping constituents, so the
total installed size for two tasks together may be less than the total
obtained by adding up the numbers.

</para><para>

Note that you will need to add the sizes listed in the table to the size
of the standard installation when determining the size of partitions.
Most of the size listed as <quote>Installed size</quote> will end up in
<filename>/usr</filename> and in <filename>/lib</filename>;
the size listed as <quote>Download size</quote>
is (temporarily) required in <filename>/var</filename>.
