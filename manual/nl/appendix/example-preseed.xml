<title>Preconfiguration File Example</title>

<para>

This is a complete working example of a preconfiguration file for an automated
install. Its use is explained in <xref linkend="automatic-install"/>. You
may want to uncomment some of the lines before using the file.

<note><para>

In order to be able to properly present this example in the manual, we've had
to split some lines. This is indicated by the use of the line-continuation-character
<quote>\</quote> and extra indentation in the next line. In a real preconfiguration
file, these split lines have to be joined into <emphasis>one single line</emphasis>.
If you do not, preconfiguration will fail with unpredictable results.

A <quote>clean</quote> example file is available from &urlset-example-preseed;.
