<para
>By far the easiest way to install &debian; is from an Official Debian CD-ROM Set. You can buy a set from a vendor (see the <ulink url="&url-debian-cd-vendors;"
>CD vendors page</ulink

>Debian CD page</ulink
> for detailed instructions). If you have a Debian CD set and CDs are bootable on your machine, you can skip right to <xref linkend="boot-installer"/>; much effort has been expended to ensure the files most people need are there on the CD. Although a full set of binary packages requires several CDs, it is unlikely you will need packages on the third CD and above. You may also consider using the DVD version, which saves a lot of space on your shelf and you avoid the CD shuffling marathon. </para

On some systems, the standard installation RAMdisk, combined with the
memory requirements of the TFTP boot image, cannot fit in memory.  In
this case, you can still install using TFTP, you'll just have to go
through the additional step of NFS mounting your root directory over
the network as well.  This type of setup is also appropriate for
diskless or dataless clients.

First, follow all the steps above in <xref linkend="install-tftp"/>.

Be sure to use the GNU <command

Installing with TFTP and NFS Root is similar to
<xref linkend="tftp-low-memory"/> because you don't want to
load the RAMdisk anymore but boot from the newly created NFS-root file
system.  You then need to replace the symlink to the tftpboot image by
a symlink to the kernel image (for example,
<filename
>linux-a.out</filename

RARP/TFTP requires all daemons to be running on the same server (the
