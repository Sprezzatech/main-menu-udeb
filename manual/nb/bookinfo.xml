>Because the &arch-title; port is not a release architecture for &releasename;, there is no official version of this manual for &arch-title; for &releasename;. However, because the port is still active and there is hope that &arch-title; may be included again in future official releases, this development version of the Installation Guide is still available. </para

>This installation guide is based on an earlier manual written for the old Debian installation system (the <quote
>boot-floppies</quote
>), and has been updated to document the new Debian installer. However, for &architecture;, the manual has not been fully updated and fact checked for the new installer. There may remain parts of the manual that are incomplete or outdated or that still document the boot-floppies installer. A newer version of this manual, possibly better documenting this architecture, may be found on the Internet at the <ulink url="&url-d-i;"
>&d-i; home page</ulink

<note condition="checked"

>Although this installation guide for &architecture; is mostly up-to-date, we plan to make some changes and reorganize parts of the manual after the official release of &releasename;. A newer version of this manual may be found on the Internet at the <ulink url="&url-d-i;"
>&d-i; home page</ulink

<para condition="translation-status"
>Translators can use this paragraph to provide some information about the status of the translation, for example if the translation is still being worked on or if review is wanted (don't forget to mention where comments should be sent!). See build/lang-options/README on how to enable this paragraph. Its condition is "translation-status". </para>
