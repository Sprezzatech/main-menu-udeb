 <title>Pre-Partitioning for Multi-Boot Systems</title>
<para>

Partitioning your disk simply refers to the act of breaking up your
disk into sections. Each section is then independent of the others.
It's roughly equivalent to putting up walls inside a house; if you add
furniture to one room it doesn't affect any other room.

Whenever this section talks about <quote>disks</quote> you should translate
this into a DASD or VM minidisk in the &arch-title; world. Also a machine
means an LPAR or VM guest in this case.

which uses the whole disk and you want to stick &debian; on the same disk, you will need to repartition
it. &debian; requires its own hard disk partitions. It cannot be
installed on Windows or MacOS partitions. It may be able to share some
partitions with other Unix systems, but that's not covered here. At
the very least you will need a dedicated partition for the &debian;
root filesystem.

You can find information about your current partition setup by using

In general, changing a partition with a file system already on
it will destroy any information there. Thus you should always make
backups before doing any repartitioning.  Using the analogy of the
house, you would probably want to move all the furniture out of the
way before moving a wall or you risk destroying it.

Several modern operating systems offer the ability to move and resize
certain existing partitions without destroying their contents.  This allows
making space for additional partitions without losing existing data.  Even
though this works quite well in most cases, making changes to the
partitioning of a disk is an inherently dangerous action and should only be
done after having made a full backup of all data.
<phrase arch="any-x86">For FAT/FAT32 and NTFS partitions as used by DOS and
Windows systems, the ability to move and resize them losslessly is provided 
both by &d-i; as well as by the integrated Disk Manager of Windows
7. </phrase>

<para arch="x86">
To losslessly resize an existing FAT or NTFS partition from within &d-i;, go
to the partitioning step, select the option for manual partitioning, select
the partition to resize, and simply specify its new size.

Creating and deleting partitions can be done from within &d-i; as
well as from an existing operating system. As a rule of thumb,
partitions should be created by the system for which they are to
be used, i.e. partitions to be used by &debian-gnu; should be
created from within &d-i; and partitions to be used from another
operating system should be created from there. &d-i; is
capable of creating non-&arch-kernel; partitions, and partitions created
this way usually work without problems when used in other operating
systems, but there are a few rare corner cases in which this could
cause problems, so if you want to be sure, use the native partitioning
tools to create partitions for use by other operating systems.
</para><para>

If you are going to install more than one operating system on the same
machine, you should install all other system(s) before proceeding with
the &debian; installation. Windows and other OS installations may destroy
your ability to start &debian;, or encourage you to reformat non-native
partitions.

</para><para>

You can recover from these actions or avoid them, but installing
the native system first saves you trouble.

In order for OpenFirmware to automatically boot &debian-gnu; the &arch-parttype;
partitions should appear before all other partitions on the disk,
especially MacOS boot partitions. This should be kept in mind when
pre-partitioning; you should create a &arch-parttype; placeholder partition to
come <emphasis>before</emphasis> the other bootable partitions on the
disk. (The small partitions dedicated to Apple disk drivers are not
bootable.) You can delete the placeholder with the &debian; partition
tools later during the actual install, and replace it with &arch-parttype;
partitions.

If you currently have one hard disk with one partition (a common setup
for desktop computers), and you want to multi-boot the native
operating system and &debian;, you will need to:

Boot from the native operating system installer media such as CD-ROM
