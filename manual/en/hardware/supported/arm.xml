<para>

Each distinct ARM architecture requires its own kernel. Because of
this the standard Debian distribution only supports installation on
a number of the most common systems. The Debian userland however may be
used by <emphasis>any</emphasis> ARM CPU.

Most ARM CPUs may be run in either endian mode (big or little). However,

<term>RiscPC</term>
<listitem><para>

This machine is the oldest supported hardware: it was released
in 1994. It has RISC OS in ROM, Linux can be booted from that OS using
linloader. The RiscPC has a modular CPU card and typically has a 30MHz
610, 40MHz 710 or 233MHz Strongarm 110 CPU fitted. The mainboard has
integrated IDE, SVGA video, parallel port, single serial port, PS/2
keyboard and proprietary mouse port. The proprietary module expansion
bus allows for up to eight expansion cards to be fitted depending on
configuration, several of these modules have Linux drivers.
