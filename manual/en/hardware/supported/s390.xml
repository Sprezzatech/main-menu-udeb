Since &debian; Squeeze, support for booting in ESA/390 mode was dropped.  Your
machine needs to support for at least the z/Architecture, Architecture Level
Set 2.  The userland is still compiled for ESA/390, though.  All zSeries
hardware is fully supported.

&arch-title; support software is included from the kernel 2.6.39 development
stream.  The most current information about IBM's Linux support can be found at
