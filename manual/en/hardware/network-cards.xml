 <title>Network Connectivity Hardware</title>
<para>

Almost any network interface card (NIC) supported by the Linux kernel
should also be supported by the installation system; modular drivers
should normally be loaded automatically.

<phrase arch="x86">This includes most PCI and PCMCIA cards.</phrase>
<phrase arch="i386">Many older ISA cards are supported as well.</phrase>

This includes a lot of generic PCI cards (for systems that have PCI) and
the following NICs from Sun:

As for ISDN, the D-channel protocol for the (old) German 1TR6 is not
supported; Spellcaster BRI ISDN boards are also not supported by the
&d-i;. Using ISDN during the installation is not supported.

  <title>Drivers Requiring Firmware</title>
<para>

The installation system currently does not support retrieving firmware.
This means that any network cards that use a driver that requires firmware
to be loaded, is not supported by default.

</para><para>

If there is no other NIC you can use during the installation, it is still
possible to install &debian; using a full CD-ROM or DVD image. Select the
option to not configure a network and install using only the packages
available from the CD/DVD. You can then install the driver and firmware you
need after the installation is completed (after the reboot) and configure
your network manually. Note that the firmware may be packaged separately
from the driver and may not be available in the <quote>main</quote> section
of the &debian; archive.

</para><para>

If the driver itself <emphasis>is</emphasis> supported, you may also be
able to use the NIC during installation by copying the firmware from some
medium to <filename>/usr/lib/hotplug/firmware</filename>. Don't forget to
also copy the firmware to that location for the installed system before
the reboot at the end of the installation.

  <sect2 condition="supports-wireless" id="nics-wireless">
  <title>Wireless Network Cards</title>
<para>

Wireless NICs are in general supported as well, with one big proviso.
A lot of wireless adapters require drivers that are either non-free or have
not been accepted into the official Linux kernel. These NICs can generally
be made to work under &debian;, but are not supported during the installation.

</para><para>

If there is no other NIC you can use during the installation, it is still
possible to install &debian; using a full CD-ROM or DVD image. Use the same
procedure as described above for NICs that require firmware.

</para><para>

In some cases the driver you need may not be available as a Debian package.
You will then have to look if there is source code available in the internet
and compile the driver yourself. How to do this is outside the scope of this
manual.
<phrase arch="x86">If no Linux driver is available, your last resort is to
use the <classname>ndiswrapper</classname> package, which allows you to use
a Windows driver.</phrase>

  <title>Known Issues for &arch-title;</title>
<para>

There are a couple of issues with specific network cards that are worth
mentioning here.

</para>

   <sect3><title>Conflict between tulip and dfme drivers</title>
<!-- BTS: #334104; may also affect other arches, but most common on sparc -->

<!-- BTS: #334104; may also affect other arches, but most common on sparc -->
There are various PCI network cards that have the same PCI identification,
but are supported by related, but different drivers. Some cards work with
the <literal>tulip</literal> driver, others with the <literal>dfme</literal>
driver. Because they have the same identification, the kernel cannot
distinguish between them and it is not certain which driver will be loaded.
If this happens to be the wrong one, the NIC may not work, or work badly.

</para><para>

This is a common problem on Netra systems with a Davicom (DEC-Tulip
compatible) NIC. In that case the <literal>tulip</literal> driver is
probably the correct one.

During the installation the solution is to switch to a shell and unload the
wrong driver module using
<userinput>modprobe -r <replaceable>module</replaceable></userinput> (or
both, if they are both loaded). After that you can load the correct module
using <userinput>modprobe <replaceable>module</replaceable></userinput>.
