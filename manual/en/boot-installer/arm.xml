<para>

There are three ways how to put the installer firmware into flash:

    <sect4 arch="arm"><title>Using the NSLU2 web interface</title>
<para>

Go to the administration section and choose the menu item
<literal>Upgrade</literal>.  You can then browse your disk for the
installer image you have previously downloaded.  Then press the
<literal>Start Upgrade</literal> button, confirm, wait for a few minutes
and confirm again.  The system will then boot straight into the installer.

You can use <command>upslug2</command> from any Linux or Unix machine to
upgrade the machine via the network.  This software is packaged for
Debian.

First, you have to put your NSLU2 in upgrade mode:

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>

Disconnect any disks and/or devices from the USB ports.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Power off the NSLU2

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Press and hold the reset button (accessible through the small hole on the
back just above the power input).

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Press and release the power button to power on the NSLU2.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Wait for 10 seconds watching the ready/status LED. After 10 seconds it
will change from amber to red. Immediately release the reset button.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

The NSLU2 ready/status LED will flash alternately red/green (there is a 1
second delay before the first green). The NSLU2 is now in upgrade mode.

</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

See the <ulink
url="http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/OpenSlug/UsingTheBinary">NSLU2-Linux
pages</ulink> if you have problems with this.

Once your NSLU2 is in upgrade mode, you can flash the new image:

<informalexample><screen>
sudo upslug2 -i di-nslu2.bin
</screen></informalexample>

Note that the tool also shows the MAC address of your NSLU2, which may come
in handy to configure your DHCP server.  After the whole image has been
written and verified, the system will automatically reboot.  Make sure you
connect your USB disk again now, otherwise the installer won't be able to
find it.
