   <title>Selecting and Installing Software</title>

<para>

During the installation process, you are given the opportunity to select
additional software to install. Rather than picking individual software
packages from the &num-of-distrib-pkgs; available packages, this stage of
the installation process focuses on selecting and installing predefined
collections of software to quickly set up your computer to perform various
tasks.

</para><para>

So, you have the ability to choose <emphasis>tasks</emphasis> first,
and then add on more individual packages later.  These tasks loosely
represent a number of different jobs or things you want to do with
your computer, such as <quote>Desktop environment</quote>,
<quote>Web server</quote>, or <quote>Print server</quote><footnote>

<para>

You should know that to present this list, the installer is merely
invoking the <command>tasksel</command> program. It can be
run at any time after installation to install (or remove) more
packages, or you can use a more fine-grained tool such as <command>aptitude</command>.
If you are looking for a specific single package, after
installation is complete, simply run <userinput>aptitude install
<replaceable>package</replaceable></userinput>, where
<replaceable>package</replaceable> is the name of the package you are
looking for.

</para>

</footnote>. <xref linkend="tasksel-size-list"/> lists the space
requirements for the available tasks.

</para><para>

Once you've selected your tasks, select
<guibutton>Ok</guibutton>. At this point,
<command>aptitude</command> will install the packages you've
selected.

<note><para>

In the standard user interface of the installer, you can use the space bar
to toggle selection of a task.

</para></note>

<note><para>

Note that some tasks may be pre-selected based on the characteristics of the
computer you are installing. If you disagree with these selections you can
un-select the tasks. You can even opt to install no tasks at all at this point.

</para></note>

</para><para>

Each package you selected with <command>tasksel</command> is downloaded,
unpacked and then installed in turn by the <command>apt-get</command> and
<command>dpkg</command> programs. If a particular program needs more
information from the user, it will prompt you during this process.

 <title>Configuring Your Mail Transport Agent</title>

<para>

Today, email is a very important part of many people's life, so it's
no surprise Debian lets you configure your mail system right as a part
of the installation process. The standard mail transport agent in
Debian is <command>exim4</command>, which is relatively small,
flexible, and easy to learn.

</para><para>

You may ask if this is needed even if your computer is not connected
to any network. The short answer is: Yes. The longer explanation: Some
system utilities (like <command>cron</command>,
<command>quota</command>, <command>aide</command>, &hellip;) may send
you important notices via email.

</para><para>

So on the first screen you will be presented with several common mail
scenarios. Choose the one that most closely resembles your needs:

</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>internet site</term>
<listitem><para>

Your system is connected to a network and your mail is sent and
received directly using SMTP. On the following screens you will be
asked a few basic questions, like your machine's mail name, or a list of
domains for which you accept or relay mail.

</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>mail sent by smarthost</term>
<listitem><para>

In this scenario is your outgoing mail forwarded to another machine,
called a <quote>smarthost</quote>, which does the actual job for
you. Smarthost also usually stores incoming mail addressed to your
computer, so you don't need to be permanently online. That also means
you have to download your mail from the smarthost via programs like
fetchmail. This option is suitable for dial-up users.

</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>local delivery only</term>
<listitem><para>

Your system is not on a network and mail is sent or received only
between local users. Even if you don't plan to send any messages, this
option is highly recommended, because some system utilities may send
you various alerts from time to time (e.g. beloved <quote>Disk quota
exceeded</quote>). This option is also convenient for new users,
because it doesn't ask any further questions.

</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>no configuration at this time</term>
<listitem><para>

Choose this if you are absolutely convinced you know what you are
doing. This will leave you with an unconfigured mail system &mdash;
until you configure it, you won't be able to send or receive any mail
and you may miss some important messages from your system utilities.

</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>

If none of these scenarios suits your needs, or if you need a finer
setup, you will need to edit configuration files under the
<filename>/etc/exim4</filename> directory after the installation is
complete. More information about <command>exim4</command> may be found
under <filename>/usr/share/doc/exim4</filename>.
