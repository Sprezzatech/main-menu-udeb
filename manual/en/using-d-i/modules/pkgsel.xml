   <title>Selecting and Installing Software</title>

<para>

During the installation process, you are given the opportunity to select
additional software to install. Rather than picking individual software
packages from the &num-of-distrib-pkgs; available packages, this stage of
the installation process focuses on selecting and installing predefined
collections of software to quickly set up your computer to perform various
tasks.

</para><para>

<!-- TODO: Should explain popcon first -->

So, you have the ability to choose <emphasis>tasks</emphasis> first,
and then add on more individual packages later.  These tasks loosely
represent a number of different jobs or things you want to do with
your computer, such as <quote>Desktop environment</quote>,
<quote>Web server</quote>, or <quote>Print server</quote><footnote>

<para>

You should know that to present this list, the installer is merely
invoking the <command>tasksel</command> program. It can be run at any
time after installation to install more packages (or remove them), or
you can use a more fine-grained tool such as <command>aptitude</command>.
If you are looking for a specific single package, after
installation is complete, simply run <userinput>aptitude install
<replaceable>package</replaceable></userinput>, where
<replaceable>package</replaceable> is the name of the package you are
looking for.

</para>

</footnote>. <xref linkend="tasksel-size-list"/> lists the space
requirements for the available tasks.

</para><para>

Some tasks may be pre-selected based on the characteristics of the
computer you are installing. If you disagree with these selections you can
un-select the tasks. You can even opt to install no tasks at all at this point.

<note><para>

<!-- TODO: Explain the "Standard system" task first -->

The <quote>Desktop environment</quote> task will install the GNOME desktop
environment. The options offered by the installer currently do not allow to
select a different desktop environment such as for example KDE.

</para><para>

It is possible to get the installer to install KDE by using preseeding
(see <xref linkend="preseed-pkgsel"/>) or by adding
<literal>tasks="standard, kde-desktop"</literal> at the boot prompt
when starting the installer<footnote>

<para>
A more lightweight Xfce desktop environment can be selected by using
<literal>xfce-desktop</literal> instead of <literal>kde-desktop</literal>.
If you are installing on a laptop, you could also add
<literal>laptop</literal> to the tasks to be installed.
</para>

</footnote>. However, this will only work if the packages
needed for KDE are actually available. If you are installing using a full
CD image, they will need to be downloaded from a mirror as KDE packages are
not included on the first full CD; installing KDE this way should work fine
if you are using a DVD image or any other installation method.

The various server tasks will install software roughly as follows.
DNS server: <classname>bind9</classname>;
File server: <classname>samba</classname>, <classname>nfs</classname>;
Mail server: <classname>exim4</classname>, <classname>spamassassin</classname>,
<classname>uw-imap</classname>;
Print server: <classname>cups</classname>;
SQL database: <classname>postgresql</classname>;
Web server: <classname>apache</classname>.

</para></note>
<para>

Once you've selected your tasks, select &BTN-CONT;. At this
point, <command>aptitude</command> will install the packages that are part
of the tasks you've selected.

</para>
<note><para>

In the standard user interface of the installer, you can use the space bar
to toggle selection of a task.

You should be aware that especially the Desktop task is very large.
Especially when installing from a normal CD-ROM in combination with a
mirror for packages not on the CD-ROM, the installer may want to retrieve
a lot of packages over the network. If you have a relatively slow
Internet connection, this can take a long time. There is no option to
cancel the installation of packages once it has started.

</para><para>

Even when packages are included on the CD-ROM, the installer may still
retrieve them from the mirror if the version available on the mirror is
more recent than the one included on the CD-ROM. If you are installing
the stable distribution, this can happen after a point release (an update
of the original stable release); if you are installing the testing
distribution this will happen if you are using an older image.

</para><para>

Each package you selected with <command>tasksel</command> is downloaded,
unpacked and then installed in turn by the <command>apt-get</command> and
<command>dpkg</command> programs. If a particular program needs more
information from the user, it will prompt you during this process.
