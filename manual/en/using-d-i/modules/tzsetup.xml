<para>

Depending on the location selected at the beginning of the installation
process, you may be shown a list of timezones relevant for that location.
If your location has only one time zone, you will not be asked anything and
the system will assume that time zone.

If for some reason you wish to set a time zone for the installed system
that does <emphasis>not</emphasis> match the selected location, there are
two options.

The simplest option is to just select a different timezone after the
installation has been completed and you've booted into the new system.
The command to do this is:

<informalexample><screen>
# dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
</screen></informalexample>

Alternatively, the time zone can be set at the very start of the
installation by passing the parameter
<userinput>time/zone=<replaceable>value</replaceable></userinput>
when you boot the installation system. The value should of course be a
valid time zone, for example <userinput>Europe/London</userinput> or
<userinput>UTC</userinput>.

For automated installations the time zone can also be set using preseeding.
