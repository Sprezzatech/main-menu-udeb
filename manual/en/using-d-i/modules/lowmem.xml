  <title>Check available memory</title>

<para>

One of the first things &d-i; does, is to check available memory.
If the available memory is limited, this component will make some
changes in the installation process which hopefully will allow
you to install &debian; on your system.

The first measure taken to reduce memory consumption by the installer
is to disable translations. If that is not sufficient, the installer
will only load components essential to complete a basic installation
by default. This reduces the functionality of the installation system.
You will be given the opportunity to load additional components manually,
but you should be aware that each component you select will use
additional memory and thus may cause the installation to fail.
