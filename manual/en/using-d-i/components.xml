 <title>Using Individual Components</title>
<para>

In this section we will describe each installer component in
detail. The components have been grouped into stages that should
be recognizable for users. They are presented in the order they
appear during the install. Note that not all modules will be used
for every installation; which modules are actually used depends on
the installation method you use and on your hardware.

</para>

  <title>Setting up Debian Installer and Hardware Configuration</title>
<para>

Let's assume the Debian Installer has booted and you are facing its
first screen.  At this time, the capabilities of &d-i; are still quite
limited. It doesn't know much about your hardware, preferred language,
or even the task it should perform. Don't worry. Because &d-i; is quite
clever, it can automatically probe your hardware, locate the rest
of its components and upgrade itself to a capable installation system.

However, you still need to help &d-i; with some information it can't
determine automatically (like selecting your preferred language, keyboard
layout or desired network mirror).

</para><para>

You will notice that &d-i; performs <firstterm>hardware detection</firstterm>
several times during this stage. The first time is targeted specifically
at the hardware needed to load installer components (e.g. your CD-ROM or
network card). As not all drivers may be available during this first run,
hardware detection needs to be repeated later in the process.

  <sect2 id="di-partition">
  <title>Partitioning and Mount Point Selection</title>
<para>

At this time, after hardware detection has been executed a final time,
&d-i; should be at its full strength, customized for the user's needs
and ready to do some real work.

As the title of this section indicates, the main task of the next few
components lies in partitioning your disks, creating filesystems,
assigning mountpoints and optionally configuring closely related issues
like LVM or RAID devices.

After partitioning the installer asks a few more questions that will be
used to set up the system it is about to install.

  <sect2 id="di-install-base">
  <title>Installing the Base System</title>
<para>

Although this stage is the least problematic, it consumes a significant
fraction of the install because it downloads, verifies and unpacks the whole
base system. If you have a slow computer or network connection, this could
take some time.

</para>

&module-base-installer.xml;
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2 id="di-install-software">
  <title>Installing Additional Software</title>
<para>

After the base system is installed, you have a usable but limited system.
Most users will want to install additional software on the system to tune it to
their needs, and the installer allows you do so. This step can take even
longer than installing the base system if you have a slow computer or
network.

These are the last bits to do before rebooting to your new system. It
