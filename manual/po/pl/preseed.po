"Preseeding provides a way to set answers to questions asked during the "
"installation process, without having to manually enter the answers while the "
"installation is running. This makes it possible to fully automate most types "
"of installation and even offers some features not available during normal "
"installations."

"There are three methods that can be used for preseeding: <firstterm>initrd</"
"firstterm>, <firstterm>file</firstterm> and <firstterm>network</firstterm>. "
"Initrd preseeding will work with any installation method and supports "
"preseeding of more things, but it requires the most preparation. File and "
"network preseeding each can be used with different installation methods. "
"With file and network preseeding the first few installer questions cannot be "
"preseeded because the preseed configuration file is only loaded after they "
"have been asked."

"An important difference between the preseeding methods is the point at which "
"the preseed configuration file is loaded and processed. For initrd "
"preseeding this is right at the start of the installation, before the first "
"question is even asked. For file preseeding this is after the CD or CD image "
"has been loaded. For network preseeding it is only after the network has "
"been configured."

"In practical terms this means for file and network preseeding that the "

"medium or low priority (like the first hardware detection run) will also "
"already have been processed."
