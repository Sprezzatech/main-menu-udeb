"This installation guide is based on an earlier manual written for the old "
"Debian installation system (the <quote>boot-floppies</quote>), and has been "
"updated to document the new Debian installer. However, for &architecture;, "
"the manual has not been fully updated and fact checked for the new "
"installer. There may remain parts of the manual that are incomplete or "
"outdated or that still document the boot-floppies installer. A newer version "
"of this manual, possibly better documenting this architecture, may be found "
"on the Internet at the <ulink url=\"&url-d-i;\">&d-i; home page</ulink>. You "
"may also be able to find additional translations there."

"Although this installation guide for &architecture; is mostly up-to-date, we "
