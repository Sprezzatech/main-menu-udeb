Each component performs its task, asking the user questions as necessary to do its job. The questions themselves are given priorities, and the priority of questions to be asked is set when the installer is started."
msgstr "Debianin asennin koostuu useista kunkin asennuksen toiminnon suorittavasta osasta. Kukin varta vasten kirjoitettu osa tekee työnsä kysyen käyttäjältä tarvittaessa. Kysymyksillä on tärkeysjärjestys, ja asentimen käynnistyessä säädetään jätetäänkö vähäpätöisemmät kysymykset kysymättä."
