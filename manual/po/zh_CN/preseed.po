Initrd preseeding will work with any installation method and supports preseeding of more things, but it requires the most preparation. File and network preseeding each can be used with different installation methods. With file and network preseeding the first few installer questions cannot be preseeded because the preseed configuration file is only loaded after they have been asked."
msgstr "一共有三种方法可用于预置: <firstterm>initrd</firstterm>，<firstterm>file</firstterm> 和 <firstterm>network</firstterm>。initrd 方法可以用于任何一种安装方式并支持较多的预置内容，但它需要的准备工作也最多。file 和 network 方法分别用于不同的安装方式。在 file 和 network 预置方法中，最初的几个安装问题无法跳过，这是因为只有回答了这些问题才能加载预先准备的配置文件。"
