"Under &debian;, it is much more likely that your OS can be repaired rather "
"than replaced if things go wrong. Upgrades never require a wholesale "
"installation; you can always upgrade in-place. And the programs are almost "
"always compatible with successive OS releases. If a new program version "
"requires newer supporting software, the Debian packaging system ensures that "
"all the necessary software is automatically identified and installed. The "
"point is, much effort has been put into avoiding the need for re-"
"installation, so think of it as your very last option. The installer is "
"<emphasis>not</emphasis> designed to re-install over an existing system."
msgstr ""
"Under &debian; är det mycket möjligt att ditt operativsystem kan lagas "
"istället för att bytas ut om saker går fel. Uppgraderingar kräver aldrig en "
"total fullständig installation; du kan alltid uppgradera direkt. Programmen "
"är nästan alltid kompatibla med tidigare utgåvor av operativsystemet. Om en "
"ny programversion kräver nyare hjälpprogramvara kommer Debians paketsystem "
"att se till att all nödvändig programvara automatiskt identifieras och "
"installeras så tänk på det som din absolut sista utväg. Installeraren är "
