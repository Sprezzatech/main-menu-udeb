Initrd preseeding will work with any installation method and supports preseeding of more things, but it requires the most preparation. File and network preseeding each can be used with different installation methods. With file and network preseeding the first few installer questions cannot be preseeded because the preseed configuration file is only loaded after they have been asked."
