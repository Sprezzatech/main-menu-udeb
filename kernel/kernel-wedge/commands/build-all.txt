build-all

This is a wrapper script that I use to build all architectures.

It expects to have the unpacked kernel packages for various arches in
../alpha, etc. modules.dep files have to be put in there too if they are
not shipped in the .deb (varies)

dpkg-cross must be installed, but you do not need a cross compiler.
