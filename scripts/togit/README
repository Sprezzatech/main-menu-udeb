To use these scripts, you need to get this and build it:

git clone git://repo.or.cz/svn-all-fast-export.git

(Apply svn-all-fast-export.patch* to it first.)

This is a work in progress.

Hints for building svn-all-fast-export:

- Install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libsvn-dev
- Run qmake to generate Makefile
- Run make
