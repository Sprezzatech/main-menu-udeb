This is a work in progress. Plan:

* Checkout svn-all-fast-export into a svn-all-fast-export subdir of
   this "togit" directory and build it:

	git clone git://repo.or.cz/svn-all-fast-export.git

	(Apply svn-all-fast-export.patch* to it first.)

	Hints for building svn-all-fast-export:
	
	- Install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libsvn-dev
	- Run qmake to generate Makefile
	- Run make

* Get a copy of d-i's svn repo from alioth, and put it in svn/d-i under
  this "togit" directory.

* Run ./convert.sh (it can be restarted as problems are fixed by passing -r)
   Output is to ./git/

* Run ./finalize.sh

* Verifying the conversion:

  ./verify.sh init
  ./verify.sh all

* Transfer git/* to /git/d-i/ on alioth, make live, prune the svn repo
  down to the parts we will keep in svn for now, etc.

* Run ./hooksetup.sh (this expects to find the repos in /git/d-i,
   and so should probably be run on alioth, after the conversion.)

* Check everything out into a d-i tree with mr.

* Finally, create .gitignore files by running ignores.sh
