Find out un-matched pairs, i.e: () "" <> []

Make sure every msgstr containing
"#. Translators, this is a menu choice.MUST BE UNDER 65 COLUMNS"

or

"#. Note to translators : Please keep your translations of the choices
#. below the 65 columns limit (which means 65 characters for most languages)"


is not longer than 65 (actually it would be better to extract the
limit out of the string, which in the abouve example would be "65")
---
Add the possibility to email automatically the responsable of the 
various languages if an error is spotted (check the diff file and
if it contains "+msgstr" email the translator)
---
when there's a variable in a multiselect msgid, make sure its position
is preserved in the corresponding msgstr:

#. Type: select
#. Choices
#: ../partitioner.templates:3
msgid "${DISCS}, Finish"
msgstr "${DISCS}, Fine"

in the above example the script should make sure that ${DISCS} isthe first item
in the msgstr
