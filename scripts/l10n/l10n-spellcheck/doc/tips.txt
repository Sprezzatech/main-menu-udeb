This was a message I sent to debian-l10n-arabic@lists.debian.org to
explain what the spellchecker is about.

---
Even if I couldn't find an Arabic dictionary for Aspell, I think you still
can find useful informations for making better translations and spotting
some errors.

ar_all.txt - contains all the Arabic strings extracted from the po files:
you can use any spellchecker against this file to look for typos.

ar_var.txt - contains the so called "suspect variables": a script compares
variables ${LIKE_THIS} in the original msgid string and in the Arabic string
and if it finds any incongruence, they're logged in the ar_var.txt file
If we take as an example ar_var.txt for level1-post-sarge, I notice that
the original string

msgid "The test of the swap space in partition #${PARTITION} of
${DEVICE} found uncorrected errors."

contains the two variables "#${PARTITION}" and "${DEVICE}" the
translated string contains, besides those 2 vars, a third variable
"${TYPE}"

the second string spotted by the script, contains no variables at all, but
the
translated string has two variables.

Could you please take a look and eventually fix what is wrong?
I'd be also interested to know it there's an aspell dictionary for your language.
