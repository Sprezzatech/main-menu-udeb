*** Under construction ***

Documentation for the spellchecker is very poor at the moment and
mostly consists of notes collected inside the "doc" dir.

I'd like to package the spellchecker in the very near future, so
the documentation files will be probably reorganised:

- part of the documentation will be integrated with the existing
  l18n documentation available at:

  http://people.debian.org/~bubulle/d-i/i18n-doc/

  will consist of information useful mainly to translators
  and will explain how to use the informations produced by the
  spellchecker in order to improve the quality of translations

- the documentation inside "doc" will be focused on explaining
  how to configure and use the spellchecker on any project
  containing po files (and not only). I'll also explain what
  each of the scripts really does.
