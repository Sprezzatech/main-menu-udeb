This directory contains digress, the d-i automatic regression tester.

To set it up locally, you can edit the files here (but don't commit them!),
or create a directory elsewhere containing config and schemes/ and point
DI_TESTDIR at it. Once it's all working, the daily-tests script can be used
to log everything in a format that will let it be put on the test log page.

Warning about passwords: No real effort is made to keep root or user
passwords from leaking into the output or log files. Hashed versions of the
passwords will be put in preseed files. Don't use important passwords, and
don't put test machines on a insecure network!

The automatic testing is accomplished by the test-harness script. This
script reads global configs from the file config, and takes the name of a
test scheme. Schemes are defined by files in the schemes/ directory, which
has subdirs for each machine, that contain a common file with common
settings for the machines, and other files defining each scheme. These
files can set config options or use other schemes. These config options
should always be set:

DESCRIPTION		Short description of what's being tested.
ARCH			Architecture of the test machine.

If your test system supports Integrated Lights Out, you can set the
following options. To use it, you'll need to get the tarball from
http://h18004.www1.hp.com/support/files/server/us/download/21456.html and
extract locfg.pl from it and place it in your path or in the utils/
directory. Note that locfg is not free software; someone want to write a
free version?

HP_ILO_HOST		Hostname of HP Integrated Lights Out server.
HP_ILO_USER		Username for the ILO.
HP_ILO_PASSWORD		Password to use to log into the ILO.
HP_ILO_PASSWORD_FILE	A file containing the password to use to log into
			the ILO.
HP_ILO_ISO_PATH		Where to put the iso image to boot using ILO.
			The iso specified in the ISO option is hard linked
			to this location, which should be somewhere in your
			web site.
HP_ILO_ISO_URL		Url to iso image made available at the HP_ILO_ISO_PATH.
HP_ILO_STAGE2_CD_HACK	Make CD available by downloading and loop mounting
			it, in case your network or iLO sucks and the
			virtual CD provided by iLO is not sufficiently
			reliable.

If your test system has a Hewlett-Packard Guardian Service Processor,
as used in some hppa systems, set the following options:

HP_GSP_CONNECTCOMMAND	Command to use to connect to the GSP.
			For example, "telnet gsp-host"
HP_GSP_USER		Username for GSP login.
HP_GSP_PASSWORD		Password for GSP login.
HP_GSP_PASSWORD_FILE	A file containing the password to use for GSP login.
HP_GSP_BOOTCOMMAND	Command to enter at the main boot menu to boot d-i.
			For example "bo pri" or "bo 0/0/0/0"
HP_GSP_REBOOTCOMMAND	Command to enter at the main boot menu to boot
			installed system. Useful if debian is installed to
			non-primary media.
If you have a sparc:

OF_BOOT_COMMAND		Command to send at the openfirmware prompt to boot
			the installer.

If you have an alpha:

ALPHA_BOOT_COMMAND	Command to send at the prompt to boot the installer.
ALPHA_REBOOT_COMMAND	Command to send at the prompt to boot the installed
			system.

If you have a raq or other machine that needs a nfs root directory to
boot from:

NFSROOT_DIR		nfs root directory to unpack image into (eg, /nfsroot)
NFSROOT_IMAGE		Path to nfsroot.tar.gz to unpack into nfs root directory.
NFSROOT_IMAGE_ALT	Alternete nfsroot image to use (if it's newer)
NFSROOT_LINK		Symlink to create to NFSROOT_DIR (nfsroot-links)

If you have a raq:

RAQ_BOOTNUM		Boot number for CoLO for 1st stage install

If you have X10 power control, you can use these settings, and use x10-on
and x10-off, or use x10-reset to force a device to cold boot.

X10_HOUSE		House code of the device.
X10_DEVICE		Device code of the device.
X10_DELAY		Delay in seconds to wait for x10 command to take
			effect. 2 is a good value, unless you need to catch
			a machine very very early in its boot process.
