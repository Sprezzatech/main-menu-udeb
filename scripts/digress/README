This directory contains digress, the d-i automatic regression tester.

The automatic testing is accomplished by the test-harness script. This
script reads global configs from the file config, and takes the name of a
test scheme. Schemes are defined by files in the schemes/ directory, which
has subdirs for each machine, that contain a common file with common
settings for the machines, and other files defining each scheme. These
files can set config options or use other schemes. These config options
should always be set:

DESCRIPTION		Short description of what's being tested.
ARCH			Architecture of the test machine.
TFTP_DIR		Path to your tftpboot directory. You need write access.
PRESEED_URL		URL to the preseed file to use.
INSTALL_LANGUAGE	Language to run the install in.
PREBOOT			Commands to run before booting.
BOOT			Command to run to boot the installer.
TEST_1			Commands to use to test the first stage of the install.
TEST_2			Commands to use to test the second stage of the install.

Some others that can be set:

BOOT_OPTS		Options to pass to the kernel.
NETBOOT_IMAGE		Path to netboot.tar.gz to boot.
NETBOOT_IMAGE_ALT	Alternate netboot.tar.gz to boot (if it's newer).
NETBOOT_IMAGE_DIR	Directory to set $TFTP_DIR/$ARCH-boot to (netboot-links)
BOOT_SELECTION		Boot option to select in boot loader (bootloader-setup)
EFI_MENUENTRY		Option to choose in the efi boot menu (ia64-boot)
CONSOLECOMMAND		Command to run to get access to the console (ia64-boot)
CONSERVER_CONSOLE	Conserver console to connect to if using that.
STAGE_1_MAX_TIME	Maximum number of seconds before failure.
STAGE_2_MAX_TIME	Maximum number of seconds before failure.
STAGE_2_DATA_GATHER	Commands to run at root prompt after install.
			Should output "Yes, looks good!" if the installed
			system looks good.
ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE	A file containing a root password for the installed
			machine.
ROOT_PASSWORD		A root password for the installed machine (not secure!)

To set it up locally, you can edit the files here (but don't commit them!),
or create a directory elsewhere containing config and schemes/ and point
DI_TESTDIR at it. Once it's all working, the daily-tests script can be used
to log everything in a format that will let it be put on the test log page.
