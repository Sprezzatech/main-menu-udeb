    Major changes because of removal of support for the Sarge version of the manual in trunk.<br/>
    Joey Hess has done a lot of updates regarding preseeding and the removal of base-config.
    Note: quite a bit of text that was previously in boot-new has been reused in using-d-i, so you may also be able to reuse your translations.
