kernel-image-di (0.011) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilt with kernel-source-2.4.2 2.4.2-3, to get initrd freeing fix,
    and initrd on cramfs support.
  * Also turned on tmpfs, for playing with as a better ramfs than ramfs.
  * Turned OFF cramfs, after noticing this:
      831k    cramfs-mnt/var/lib/dpkg/info
      110k    ext2-mnt/var/lib/dpkg/info
    Same contents; cramfs does poorly with lots of small files, compared to
    appropriatly tuned ext2.
  * Well, I'll leave cramfs as a module.

kernel-image-di (0.010) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to 2.4.2 kernel.
  * Fixed Binary: line in .dsc file. This was painful, and involded adding
    a control.template to the package, which is what should be edited form
    now on. debian/control is automatically generated, but I am leaving it
    in cvs so one can check out the package and build it with
    dpkg-buildpackage.
  * Made kernel image deb depend on initrd-tools.

kernel-image-di (0.008) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented module dependancy checking. It is now impossible to
    produce a set of module udebs that have broken module dependancies.
    Cross-udeb depedancies are also examined.
  * Moved the module lists out to debian/package.list files.

kernel-image-di (0.007) unstable; urgency=low

kernel-image-di (0.006) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build in crams and ramfs. We're going to boot off of a cramfs initrd
    and then set up and pivot_root into a ramfs filesystem.
  * Left ext2 in, non-modularized, but this may change later, once above is
    working.

kernel-image-di (0.005) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to 2.4.1 kernel source.
  * Enabled reiserfs as a module.

kernel-image-di (0.004) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added another udeb that holds the actual kernel image. This is
    handy because the d-i build system can then just install that udeb and
    move the kernel image onto the boot floppy image. And the udeb will
    be listed in d-i's status file, so all the module dependancies will
    be met.
  * Correct override disparities, I hope.
