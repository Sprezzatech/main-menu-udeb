This package is used to build a kernel-image.deb and a bunch of associated
udebs for the debian-installer project. The kernel image is built with
the bare minumum compiled in (initrd and ext2fs support, mostly). Every
module that can be sanely turned on, is.

The kernel config is stored in this package, in config.$ARCH. The actual
kernel source is pulled in by build dependancies, and kernel-package is
used to do the building.

As a convenience, you can use 'debian/rules configure' to run xconfig on
the appropriate config file.

The debian/control.template file is the real control file, so edit it
rather than debian/control, which will be generated from it as needed.
The first package in the control file is the kernel-image.deb to build. The
second is the kernel-image.udeb to build (this contains only a vmlinu[xz]
file). All remaining packages are module .udebs, which each contain a set of
modules.

Files named debian/package.list list the modules that go in each module
udeb. The build system will make sure that you don't have broken module
dependancies.

If you are a porter, make a new config.$ARCH for your architecture.
If you need various flavors, talk to JoeyH, a mechanism for these is not
yet in place, but is planned. You will also need to add the modules
particular to your port to the module udeb Provides: lines.

If you are a user who wants to build a custom kernel, I hope the above
provides enough information for you to make a stab at it.
