* config really needs to be better researched -- I hope to just use the one
  Herbert Xu comes up with in the official debian 2.4.0 kernel image, when 
  he makes one, with minimal changes.
* It should be a lot smarter about module dependancies. Something like:
  - run depmod on all available modules to get a modules.dep
  - parse that, so it knows what modules depend on what.
  - if module foo.o is in package modfoo, and foo.o depends on bar.o, then
    bar.o needs to be in either modfoo, or in a package modfoo depends on.
    Die if it is not.
