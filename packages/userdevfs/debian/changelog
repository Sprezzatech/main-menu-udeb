userdevfs (0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Wouter Verhelst
    - we don't build binary-arch packages, so don't make that target do
      anything. I wonder what crack I was on when I did that, but it's fixed
      now; Closes: #223092.
    - removed debian/isinstallable; it's useless for us and replaced by
      code in init-dev and update-dev anyway now.
  * Stephen R. Marenka
    - Create non-devfs nodes and symlink them into /dev/disc/*.
    - Rework init-dev to include cdrom detection and loopback devices.
    - Put checks in place to make sure it only runs with 2.2.x kernel.
    - Add floppy device.
