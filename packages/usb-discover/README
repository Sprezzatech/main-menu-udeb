This is a small module to automatically discover USB modules.
It uses a list of PCI ids for host bridges for USB, taken from discover-data,
and uses these to decide when to modprobe the OHCI, UHCI, and EHCI modules.
(This is necessary because probing the wrong one will cause the system
to hang).

Note that the lst files in the source are only for adding data; most of the
data is pulled directly from the discover1 database.
