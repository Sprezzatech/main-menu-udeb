  * Drop dependency on gtk2-engines-udeb and mouse-modules. Leave it to
    pkg-lists to include them instead.

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * Only start X if we're using the GTK frontend. Also try to not start X
    clients before the server is ready to accept connections. Closes: #575751.

  * Switch to X.Org instead of DirectFB as backend (closes: #574288):
    - No longer install directfb-related files, but keep them in the source
      for now.
    - src/lib/debian-installer.d/S62Xorg: new script to start the X server.

  * Upgrade to debhelper v7.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Remove no longer needed Lintian override for missing Standards-
    Version field.
  * No longer create the /usr/local/etc->/etc symlink. It was added to
    suppress a message on VT1 when directfb is loaded, but that is no longer
    displayed because we now set the 'quiet' option in /etc/directfbrc.
    Closes: #552584.

rootskel-gtk (1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since the switch from kernel 2.6.22-3 to 2.6.24-1 there have been problems
    typing special characters in the graphical frontend when using some
    keymaps. Not disabling the keyboard module in /etc/directfbrc solves this.
    That option was added to workaround an issue that prevented changing
    keymaps, but that still works (#395257). So it appears we can now safely
    use the directfb keyboard module and drop the workaround. Closes: 482335.
    There are still issues with dead keys.

  [ Jérémy Bobbio ]
  * Add debian-installer.d/S62directfb-cairo-workaround, exporting
    CAIRO_DIRECTFB_NO_ACCEL to work around a repainting issue in
    Cairo/DirectFB (see #477331).

  * Since the radeon HW accellerator module is no longer provided by udebs,
    it makes no sense to selectively disable it at boot time.

  * gtk-set-font: using grep's -s option is so much more elegant.
  * Disable directfb ps2mouse module (except for powerpc) because it can
    freeze the system while the linux_input module does not. This is needed
    only now as CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV was enabled by default in 2.6.18 which
    "activated" the ps2mouse directfb module. Thanks to Attilio Fiandrotti for
    providing the solution. Closes: #403268.

    Thanks to Attilio Fiandrotti for his research on this.
  * Add "dark" accessibility theme created by Denis Barbier.
    Requires fontconfig-udeb 2.4.2-1.
