 will be loaded automatically and are not listed here. Some other
 (optional) installer components are shown below. They are probably
 not necessary, but may be interesting to some users.

_Description: Installer components to load:
 To save memory, only components that are certainly needed for an install
 are selected by default. The other installer components are not all necessary
 for a basic install, but you may need some of them, especially certain kernel
 modules, so look through the list carefully and select the components you
 need.
 .
 Note that if you select a component that requires others, those
 components will also be loaded.

_Description: Continue the install without loading kernel modules?
 No kernel modules were found. This probably is due to a mismatch between
 the kernel used by this version of the installer and the kernel version
 available in the archive.
 .
 If you're installing from a mirror, you can work around this problem by
 choosing to install a different version of Debian. The install will probably
 fail to work if you continue without kernel modules.
