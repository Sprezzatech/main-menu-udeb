* Put up the progress bar on startup, at least before retrieving the
  Packages file.

* Release files

* Better error-resistance. One failing package shouldn't shoot everything.
  (Partly done now that we have retriever error correction.)

* "Tasks". Only list udebs that have a certain control field. Use the contents
  of that control field as info in the list. Other udebs will be pulled in by
  dependencies.

* Include all packages that will be autoinstalled in the question about
  what to install, in addition to those that will not be installed.
  In corner cases the user may need to omit a particular package
  from being installed even though it would be normally (think kernel
  module udeb with a module that hangs with the given HW or something).
