auto-install (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Philip Hands ]
  * check for dhcp preseed (closes: #511683)
    This needs localechooser >= 2.10 and kbd-chooser >= 1.46 to work
    properly, although that is not a Depends: as this is relying on
    side-effects of the isinstallable scripts in those packages rather
    than actually needing to have them installed before this.

auto-install (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * rely on localechooser.isinstallable to flag when we need to ask for
    preseed/url, flagged by /var/run/preseed_unspecified_at_boot
    (was /var/run/auto-install-had-to-ask-for-preseed briefly)

auto-install (1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * make auto-install ask for preseed/url if neither it nor preseed/file are
    set,  as otherwise the auto-install is bound to fail, and we're offering
    "Automatic Installation" as a menu item, so that's going to frustrate newbies.
    When we've had to ask, touch /var/run/auto-install-had-to-ask-for-preseed

auto-install (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depends on keyboard-setup virtual package so we can use alternative
    method to setup it. This to work requires kbd-chooser (>> 1.36) or
    console-setup (>> 1.19)
