A few packages use debconf variables from d-i as part of their install, and
these variables need to be copied into the debconf db in /target:

debian-installer/language
debian-installer/country
        Used by dictionaries-common to determine which dictionary to default to.
passwd/username
	Used by exim4-config to determine where to send root mail.
