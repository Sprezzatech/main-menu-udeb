  [ Dann Frazier ]
  * Add support for a /usr/lib/pre-pkgsel.d run-parts syle directory.
    Closes: #447326.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Support CD/DVD changing during package installation.
    For this to be possible, the installation CD/DVD has to be unmounted in
    the D-I environment, which means that during most of pkgsel (including
    pre-pkgsel.d scripts) the installation of udebs is not possible. The
    installation CD/DVD is reloaded before the end of pkgsel to ensure
    following components can again install udebs.

    bar.

  * Stop removing popularity-contest for now until the cdebconf PURGE crash
    is fixed.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Consolidate debconf-copydbs into one command.
  * Pass -q to a few apt-get commands, to avoid gratuotous logging of download
    progress (the main cause of this will be fixed in tasksel though).
  * Propigate out nonzero exit codes from tasksel to main-menu so that it can
    signal a back up.

  * Fix di-utils build-dependency, and bump required version to 1.20 for

      sed by dictionaries-common to determine which dictionary to default to.
    passwd/username
      Used by exim4-config to determine where to send root mail.
