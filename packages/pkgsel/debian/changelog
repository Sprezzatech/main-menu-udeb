pkgsel (0.02) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Set LANG to C in postinst so that the bare chroot calls don't trigger
    perl warning messages for C.UTF-8 locale. (See #344159)
  * Note that this does not affect the LANG set for the main package
    installation run, which will be handled by in-target.
  * Fix progress bar title.
