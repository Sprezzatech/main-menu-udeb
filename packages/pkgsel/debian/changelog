  * Log the start of the different stages of pkgsel.
  * No longer disable Recommends; it is now a global setting. Also drop the
    template pkgsel/include/install-recommends as that is now redundant.
    The --without-recommends option is preserved for the security update
    step to avoid installing new packages during that step. Allowing it
    there would result in inconsistent behavior.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Upgrade to debhelper v7.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Remove no longer needed Lintian override for missing Standards-
    Version field.

  * Support CD/DVD changing during package installation.
    For this to be possible, the installation CD/DVD has to be unmounted in
    the D-I environment, which means that during most of pkgsel (including
    pre-pkgsel.d scripts) the installation of udebs is not possible. The
    installation CD/DVD is reloaded before the end of pkgsel to ensure
