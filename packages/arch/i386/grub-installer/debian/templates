_Description: Device for boot loader installation:
 You need to make the newly installed Debian system bootable, by installing
 the GRUB bootloader on a bootable device. The usual way to do this is to
 install GRUB on the master boot record of your first hard drive. If you
 prefer, you can install GRUB elsewhere on the drive, or to another drive,
 or even to a floppy.
 .
 The device can be specified using GRUB's "(hdn)" notation, or as a device
 in /dev.
