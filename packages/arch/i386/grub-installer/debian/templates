Type: string
Default: (hd0)
_Description: Device for boot loader installation:
 Now it is time to make the newly installed Debian system bootable, by
 installing the GRUB bootloader on a bootable device. The usual way to do
 this is to install GRUB on the master boot record of your first hard drive.
 .
 Note that GRUB counts devices differently than the Linux kernel, so the
 first drive is usually '(hd0)'. If you want it on the second partition of
 the first drive, use '(hd0,1)'. Leave this at default if unsure.
 .
 Warning: by default, this will change how your computer boots,
 overwriting your existing master boot record with GRUB. Continuing may
 make other operating systems installed on this computer unbootable.

Type: boolean
Default: yes
_Description: GRUB installation failed.  Continue anyway?
 The grub package failed to install into /target/.  Installing GRUB
 as a boot loader is a required step.  The install problem might however be
 unrelated to GRUB, so continuing the installation may be possible.
