Template: grub-installer/with_other_os
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?
 The following other operating systems have been detected on this
 computer: ${OS_LIST}
 .
 If all of your operating systems are listed above, then it should be safe to
 install the boot loader to the master boot record of your first hard
 drive. When your computer boots, you will be able to choose to load one of
 these operating systems or your new system.

Template: grub-installer/only_debian
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?
 It seems that this new installation is the only operating system
 on this computer. If so, it should be safe to install the GRUB boot loader
 to the master boot record of your first hard drive.
 .
 Warning: If the installer failed to detect another operating system that
 is present on your computer, modifying the master boot record will make
 that operating system temporarily unbootable, though GRUB can be manually
 configured later to boot it.

Template: grub-installer/sataraid
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the SATA RAID disk?
 Installation of GRUB on Serial ATA RAID is experimental.
 .
 GRUB is always installed to the master boot record (MBR) of the SATA RAID
 disk. It is also assumed that that disk is listed as the first hard disk
 in the boot order defined in the system's BIOS setup.
 .
 The GRUB root device is: ${GRUBROOT}.

Template: grub-installer/sataraid-error
Type: error
_Description: Unable to configure GRUB
 An error occurred during the setup of GRUB for your SATA RAID disk.
 .
 The installation of GRUB will be aborted.

Template: grub-installer/install_to_xfs
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to XFS file system?
 The GRUB boot loader installation often fails or hangs when /boot is on a
 XFS file system. Using LILO in this situation is recommended.

Template: grub-installer/bootdev
Type: string
_Description: Device for boot loader installation:
 You need to make the newly installed system bootable, by installing
 the GRUB boot loader on a bootable device. The usual way to do this is to
 install GRUB on the master boot record of your first hard drive. If you
 prefer, you can install GRUB elsewhere on the drive, or to another drive,
 or even to a floppy.
 .
 The device can be specified using GRUB's "(hdn,m)" notation, or as a device
 in /dev. Below are some examples:
  - "(hd0)" or "/dev/hda" will install GRUB to the master boot record
    of your first hard drive (IDE);
  - "(hd0,1)" or "/dev/hda2" will use the second partition of your
    first IDE drive;
  - "(hd2,4)" or "/dev/sdc5" will use the first extended partition of
    your third drive (SCSI here);
  - "(fd0)" or "/dev/fd0" will install GRUB to a floppy.

Template: grub-installer/password
Type: password
_Description: GRUB password:
 The GRUB boot loader offers many powerful interactive features, which could
 be used to compromise your system if unauthorized users have access to the
 machine when it is starting up. To defend against this, you may choose a
 password which will be required before editing menu entries or entering the
 GRUB command-line interface. By default, any user will still be able to
 start any menu entry without entering the password.
 .
 If you do not wish to set a GRUB password, leave this field blank.

Template: grub-installer/password-crypted
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: for internal use; can be preseeded
 Has the value of grub-installer/password already been encrypted?

Template: grub-installer/apt-install-failed
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: GRUB installation failed.  Continue anyway?
 The grub package failed to install into /target/.  Installing GRUB
 as a boot loader is a required step.  The install problem might however be
 unrelated to GRUB, so continuing the installation may be possible.

Template: grub-installer/grub-install-failed
Type: error
_Description: Unable to install GRUB in ${BOOTDEV}
 Executing 'grub-install ${BOOTDEV}' failed.
 .
 This is a fatal error.

Template: grub-installer/update-grub-failed
Type: error
_Description: Unable to configure GRUB
 Executing 'update-grub' failed.
 .
 This is a fatal error.

Template: grub-installer/grub2_instead_of_grub_legacy
Type: boolean
Default: false
# This is suitable for testing grub2 only. Do not translate it!
Description: Install GRUB 2 instead of GRUB Legacy?
 GRUB 2 is the next generation of GNU GRUB. It has interesting new features but
 is still experimental software. If you choose to install it, you should be
 prepared for breakage, and have an idea on how to recover your system if it
 becomes unbootable. You're advised not to try this in production
 environments.
