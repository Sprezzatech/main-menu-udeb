_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?
 The following other operating systems have been detected on this
 computer: ${OS_LIST}
 .
 If all of your operating systems are listed above, then it should be safe to
 install the boot loader to the master boot record of your first hard
 drive. When your computer boots, you will be able to choose to load one of
 these operating systems or your new Debian system.

_Description: Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record?
 It seems that this installation of Debian is the only operating system
 on this computer. If so, it should be safe to install the GRUB boot loader
 to the master boot record of your first hard drive.
 .
 Warning: If the installer failed to detect another operating system that
 is present on your computer, modifying the master boot record will make
 that operating system temporarily unbootable, though GRUB can be manually
 configured later to boot it.

_Description: Install the GRUB bootloader to XFS filesystem?
 The GRUB bootloader installation often fails or hangs when /boot is on a
 XFS filesystem. Using LILO in this situation is recommended.

_Description: Device for boot loader installation:
 You need to make the newly installed Debian system bootable, by installing
 the GRUB bootloader on a bootable device. The usual way to do this is to
 install GRUB on the master boot record of your first hard drive. If you
 prefer, you can install GRUB elsewhere on the drive, or to another drive,
 or even to a floppy.
 .
 The device can be specified using GRUB's "(hdn,m)" notation, or as a device
 in /dev. Below are some examples:
  - "(hd0)" or "/dev/hda" will install GRUB to the master boot record of
    your first hard drive (IDE);
  - "(hd0,1)" or "/dev/hda2" will use the second partition of your first
    IDE drive;
  - "(hd2,4)" or "/dev/sdc5" will use the first extended partition of your
    third drive (SCSI here);
  - "(fd0)" or "/dev/fd0" will install GRUB to a floppy.

Type: boolean
Default: yes
_Description: GRUB installation failed.  Continue anyway?
 The grub package failed to install into /target/.  Installing GRUB
 as a boot loader is a required step.  The install problem might however be
 unrelated to GRUB, so continuing the installation may be possible.
