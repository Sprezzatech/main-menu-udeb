_Description: LILO installation target:
 The LILO program needs to be installed to make your new system
 bootable. By installing it onto your disk's Master Boot Record, LILO will
 take complete control of the boot process, but if you want to use a
 different boot manager, just install LILO on the new Debian partition instead.
 .
 If unsure, install LILO into the Master Boot Record.

_Description: Would you like to make this partition active?
 You have chosen to install LILO on a partition that is not the active one.
 If this partition is not marked active, then LILO will not be loaded by the
 boot loader.  This may cause you to be unable to boot into the system
 that is being installed.
 .
 You should make this partition active unless you have another boot loader
 that will allow you to access your new Linux installation.
