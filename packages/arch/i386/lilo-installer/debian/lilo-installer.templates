__Choices: ${disc} : Master Boot Record, ${part} : new Debian partition, Other choice (Advanced)
_Description: Choice for LILO installation:
 The LILO program needs to be installed to make your new Debian system
 bootable. By installing it onto your disk's Master Boot Record, LILO will
 take complete control of the boot process, but if you want to use a
 different boot manager, just install LILO on the new Debian partition instead.
 .
 If unsure, install LILO into the Master Boot Record.

Template: lilo-installer/activate-part
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Would you like to make this partition active?
 You have chosen to install LILO on a partition that is not the active one.
 If this partition is not marked active, then LILO will not be loaded by the
 bootloader.  This may cause you to be unable to boot into the system
 that is being installed.
 .
 You should make this partition active unless you have another bootloader
 that will allow you to access your new Linux installation.

Template: lilo-installer/apt-install-failed
Type: boolean
Default: yes
_Description: LILO installation failed.  Continue anyway?
 The lilo package failed to install into /target/.  Installing LILO
 as a boot loader is a required step.  The install problem might however be
 unrelated to LILO, so continuing the installation may be possible.
