Steps to add a new language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- l10n/po/: Write your .po file as usual.

- l10n/Makefile: Add your language to LINGUAS variable.

Enabling it in the installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

** PLEASE ** only do this when you have tested it works!  (wine-based test
is ok).  If you can't test it, just skip this part untill somebody who can
confirm it adds the missing bits.

In main.nsi, add the following lines (each in appropiate place):

  !include l10n/templates/$LANG.nsh

  [...]

  ; LANG_MYLANGUAGE must be a valid string recognised by Nsis.  If your
  ; language is not yet supported by Nsis, please translate the missing
  ; Nsis part first.
  Push ${LANG_MYLANGUAGE}
  Push Mylanguage
