  * Add page to allow user into rescue mode.
  * Preseed quietness on non-expert installs.
  * Disable LicenseForceSelection.
  * Add dialog to choose desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, None).
    (Closes: #442209)
  * Detect and preseed passwd/user-fullname (without setting the seen flag).
  * Do not preseed "interface=auto". Do not set the seen flag for
    "domain" and "time/zone".
  * Correct a pair of mistakes in English strings (thanks Jens Seidel).
  * Fix dialog.nsh generation for languages whose names have more than
    one word (welcome, Norwegian Bokmål).
  * Clarify translator note for "windows-1252" string.
  * Add "biosdisk", "ntfscomp" and "gpt" GRUB modules.  Build-Depend on
    grub-pc (>= 1.95+20080101-1).
  * Abort on Windows 95 / 98.  (Closes: #461344)
  * Implement preseeding via initrd (with gzip.exe / cpio.exe).  Migrate the
    majority of preseed parameters to this method, in order to avoid Linux
    cmdline limits.  (Closes: #442474)

win32-loader (0.6.0~pre2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add reference to /usr/share/common-licenses.
    - debian/copyright
    - debian/control (Depends): Add base-files (>= 4.0.1).
  * Put debian-boot as Maintainer, and myself in Uploaders.
  * Support for using a different charset in NTLDR.  Defaults to cp437,
    which works for languages with latin charset.  Other translations
    will need to change this setting in their respective PO files.
    (Closes: #440471)
  * Misc fixes in l10n infrastructure that will enable build on any system
    where locales-all (added to Build-Depends) is installed, no matter the
    locale setup.  (Closes: #441193)
  * Get rid of hardcoded language lists in main.nsi.  All this cruft is
    now generated dynamicaly by l10n/Makefile (based on $(LINGUAS)).
