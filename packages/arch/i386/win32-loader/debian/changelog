win32-loader (0.6.0~pre2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add reference to /usr/share/common-licenses.
    - debian/copyright
    - debian/control (Depends): Add base-files (>= 4.0.1).
  * Put debian-boot as Maintainer, and myself in Uploaders.
  * Support for using a different charset in NTLDR.  Defaults to cp437,
    which works for languages with latin charset.  Other translations
    will need to change this setting in their respective PO files.
    (Closes: #440471)
  * Misc fixes in l10n infrastructure that will enable build on any system
    where locales-all (added to Build-Depends) is installed, no matter the
    locale setup.  (Closes: #441193)
  * Get rid of hardcoded language lists in main.nsi.  All this cruft is
    now generated dynamicaly by l10n/Makefile (based on $(LINGUAS)).
