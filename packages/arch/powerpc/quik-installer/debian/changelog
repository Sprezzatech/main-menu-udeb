quik-installer (0.0.11) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Remove redundant "the new Debian GNU/Linux system". Saying "The new
      system is now ready to boot" is sufficient, and branding-friendlier.
    - Throw an error if resolving the /initrd.img or /boot/initrd.img
      symlink fails, now that we're out of string freeze.
    - Use more serial-console-friendly text from partconf to refer the user
      to the third console or /var/log/messages.

    - Fix the spelling of "file system".
  * Colin Watson
    - Issue scarier warning (non_powermac_warning renamed to
      non_oldworld_warning) on non-OldWorld systems.
    - Default quik-installer/oldworld_warning answer to true, since it's
      been explicitly requested and is appropriate for this type of machine
      (part of #295996).

    - Initial release. Some inspiration taken from yaboot-installer, and
      some from boot-floppies.
    - This is ENTIRELY UNTESTED. I have a suitable machine, but haven't got
      it powered up yet. However, people have volunteered to test it ...
