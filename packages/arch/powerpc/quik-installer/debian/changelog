quik-installer (0.0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Martin Michlmayr
    - Stop using df to find the /target partition (fails on 100 gb drives
      due to field width issues), and make the file system type be found in
      a way that is less prey to false positives.
  * Colin Watson
    - Fix 'findfs /' (mount outputs "on /target", not "on /target/").

quik-installer (0.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Initial release. Some inspiration taken from yaboot-installer, and
      some from boot-floppies.
    - This is ENTIRELY UNTESTED. I have a suitable machine, but haven't got
      it powered up yet. However, people have volunteered to test it ...
    - Initial translations seeded from yaboot-installer.
