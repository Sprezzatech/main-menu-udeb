quik-installer (0.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Initial release. Some inspiration taken from yaboot-installer, and
      some from boot-floppies.
    - This is ENTIRELY UNTESTED. I have a suitable machine, but haven't got
      it powered up yet. However, people have volunteered to test it ...
    - Initial translations seeded from yaboot-installer.
