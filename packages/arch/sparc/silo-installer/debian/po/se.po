"In order to be successfully loaded by SILO (Sparc Linux Loader), the kernel "

"To avoid problems it is strongly recommended to install the kernel into a "

"current partitioning scheme it is going to be installed onto the "
"${SILO_PART} partition which extends up to ${SILO_OFF} mark. Keeping this "
