"To be bootable from the PROM, silo and the kernel it loads must be installed "
"on a disk which uses Sun disklabels for its partition table.  Your /boot "

"SILO requires /boot to be located on an ext2 or ext3 partition on a bootable "

"You are using a 32-bit SPARC machine. On many of these, it is unlikely that "
"Debian will boot if /boot resides in a partition that extends past the first "
"1024 cylinders of the hard disk. /boot currently resides in a partition that "
"extends to cylinder ${CYL}. You should change this by reducing the size of "
"the partition or creating a separate, smaller partition just for /boot."
