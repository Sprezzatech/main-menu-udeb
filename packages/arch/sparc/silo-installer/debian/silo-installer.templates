Template: silo-installer/apt-install-failed
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: SILO installation failed.  Continue anyway?
 The 'silo' package failed to install into /target/.  Installing SILO
 as a boot loader is a required step.  The install problem might however be
 unrelated to SILO, so continuing the installation may be possible.

_Description: SILO installation successful

Template: silo-installer/non-sun-partitions
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Install /boot on a disk with an unsupported partition table?
 To be bootable from the PROM, silo and the kernel it loads must be
 installed on a disk which uses Sun disklabels for its partition
 table.  Your /boot directory is not located on such a disk.  If you
 proceed, you will not be able to boot your system using SILO, and will
 need to boot it some other way.

Template: silo-installer/non-ext2-boot
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Use unsupported filesystem type for /boot?
 SILO requires /boot to be located on an ext2 or ext3 partition on
 a bootable device.  This means that either the root partition must be
 an ext2 filesystem, or you must have a separate ext2 partition mounted at
 /boot.
 .
 Currently, /boot is located on a partition of type ${PARTTYPE}.  If you
 keep this setting, you will not be able to boot your Debian system
 using SILO.

Template: silo-installer/boot-after-1024cyl
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Install /boot on a disk with an unsupported partition table?
 For many 32-bit SPARC machines, the PROM has a restriction that the kernel
 and boot block be on a partition that resides within 1024 cylinders of the
 hard disk. In this case, you would be booting from ${BPART}, and it extends
 or resides beyond the 1024th cylinder. You will not be able to boot your
 Debian system using this configuration.
