Template: silo-installer/apt-install-failed
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: SILO installation failed.  Continue anyway?
 The 'silo' package failed to install into /target/.  Installing SILO
 as a boot loader is a required step.  The install problem might however be
 unrelated to SILO, so continuing the installation may be possible.

 Running "/sbin/silo" failed with error code "${ERRCODE}".

Template: silo-installer/success
Type: note
_Description: SILO installation successful
 The SILO bootloader has been successfully installed on your new Debian
 boot partition, and your system should now be able to boot itself.

Template: silo-installer/non-sun-partitions
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Install /boot on a disk with an unsupported partition table?
 To be bootable from the PROM, silo and the kernel it loads must be
 installed on a disk which uses Sun disklabels for its partition
 table.  Your /boot directory is not located on such a disk.  If you
 proceed, you will not be able to boot your system using SILO, and will
 need to boot it some other way.

Template: silo-installer/non-ext2-boot
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Use unsupported file system type for /boot?
 SILO requires /boot to be located on an ext2 or ext3 partition on
 a bootable device.  This means that either the root partition must be
 an ext2 file system, or you must have a separate ext2 partition mounted at
 /boot.
 .
 Currently, /boot is located on a partition of type ${PARTTYPE}.  If you
 keep this setting, you will not be able to boot your Debian system
 using SILO.

Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Install /boot on a disk with an unsupported partition table?
 You are using a 32-bit SPARC machine. On many of these, it is unlikely that
 Debian will boot if /boot resides in a partition that extends past the
 first 1024 cylinders of the hard disk. /boot currently resides in a
 partition that extends to cylinder ${CYL}. You should change this by reducing
 the size of the partition or creating a separate, smaller partition just for
 /boot.
