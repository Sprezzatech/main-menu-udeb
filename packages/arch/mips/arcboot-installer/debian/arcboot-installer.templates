_Description: Setting PROM variables for Arcboot
 If this is the first Linux installation on this machine, or if the
 hard drives have been repartitioned, some variables need to be set
 in the PROM before the system is able to boot normally.
 .
 At the end of this installation stage, the system will reboot.  After this,
 enter the command monitor from the "Stop for Maintenance" option,
 and enter the following commands:
 .
    setenv SystemPartition scsi(${BOOTBUS})disk(${BOOTID})rdisk(${BOOTLUN})partition(8)
    setenv OSLoadPartition scsi(${ROOTBUS})disk(${ROOTID})rdisk(${ROOTLUN})partition(${ROOTPART})
    setenv OSLoader arcboot
    setenv OSLoadFilename Linux
 .
 You will only need to do this once.  Afterwards, enter the "boot" command
 or reboot the system to proceed to your newly installed system.
