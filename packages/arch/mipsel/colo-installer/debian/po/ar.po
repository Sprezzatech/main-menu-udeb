# translation of tools_lilo-installer.po to Arabic
# Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
# documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
# this format, e.g. by running:
# info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
# info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
# Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
# /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
# or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
# Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.
