Template: colo-installer/apt-install-failed
Type: boolean
_Description: colo installation failed.  Continue anyway?
 The colo package failed to install into /target/.  Installing colo as a
 boot loader is a required step.  The install problem might however be
 unrelated to colo, so continuing the installation may be possible.
Default: yes
