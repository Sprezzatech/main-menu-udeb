 - So far, I have mostly focused on preseeding information that is needed
   in order to get to network-console without the need of a serial cable.
   However, there is potentially more information on a device (e.g.
   users) that could be preseeded.

 - More hardware support.

 - Better error handling: e.g. make some sound on NSLU2 if we cannot
   preseed networking.
