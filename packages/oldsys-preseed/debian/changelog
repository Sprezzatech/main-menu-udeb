oldsys-preseed (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Martin Michlmayr ]
  * Add support for the Thecus N2100 and N4100.
  * Also handle NSLU2 when archdetect returns arm/ixp4xx.
  * Make sure the testsuite removes its temporary files.
  * Don't write a preseed file if the system is unknown - this allows it
    to put oldsys-preseed on the initrd even if not all machines are
    supported.
