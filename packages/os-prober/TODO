Ideas for a linux-boot-proper:

- Look at etc/lilo.conf, boot/grub/menu.lst to get:
	- kernel
	- parameters
	- initrd
- Partition names in boot loader config may have changed during
  the debian install, so cannot be trusted. Fix up root= lines,
  etc.
- To get to boot/, may need to parse fstab. Hmm, this makes it hard because
  as noted above, drive names may have changed!
- Maybe do some probing before partitioning and store info?
  Or don't support adding partitions before existing /boot partitions.
- Return info in form similar to os-prober:
  
  rootpart:bootpart:kernel:initrd:parameters

  The bootpart is the partition that contains the kernel and initrd.
  The kernel and initrd files are given relative to this partition.
