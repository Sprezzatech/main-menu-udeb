os-prober (0.07) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Add a Mac OS 6-9 check for powerpc. This is currently a copy of the
      m68k version with a different loader name for yaboot's benefit, which
      may not be ideal ...
    - Send modprobe's standard output to syslog so that it doesn't confuse
      programs parsing os-prober's output.

os-prober (0.06) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Add a Linux boot probe for /etc/yaboot.conf.
    - Make sure hfs is available for the Mac OS 9 check.
    - Delay hfs until last in mounted checks so that we can tell the
      difference between that and hfsplus.
    - Add count to Mac OS X labels; change loader type to macosx.
    - Add myself to Uploaders.

os-prober (0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Return "hurd" as the OS type for hurd, rather than "multiboot".
      The latter is not enough info to boot the hurd.
    - Fix broken hurd detection.
