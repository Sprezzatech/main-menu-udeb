os-prober (1.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip grub-installer's "(on /dev/blah)" entries detected in GRUB
    configuration files, as if they're useful they will probably be found by
    another probe, and detecting them can result in exponential growth of
    menu.lst files if you do repeated test installs on multiple partitions.
  * Use readlink -f in mapdevfs shim so that os-prober runs outside d-i
    handle mount-by-UUID correctly.
  * Use mktemp -d rather than /tmp, to make use outside d-i safer.
  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Try to install fs-core-modules and fs-secondary-modules udebs. These
      are specific to the Ubuntu kernel udeb layout, but it's fairly cheap
      to check for them as well and saves on divergence here.
    - Add os-probes/mounted/sparc/80solaris to recognize Solaris/SPARC
      (Fabio M. Di Nitto).
    - Add linux-boot-probes/mounted/sparc/50silo support (Fabio M. Di
      Nitto).
    - Try to load ufs module, for Solaris support (Fabio M. Di Nitto).
    - Tighten check for whether we're running in d-i; anna-install isn't
      quite enough because if you're running d-i code outside d-i it's
      sometimes reasonable to install a shim for anna-install.
  * Don't probe partitions mounted on /target/boot.
  * Teach linux-boot-prober to deal with mounted partitions correctly,
    unless they're mounted on /, /target, or /target/boot (LP: #14780). This
    should largely obsolete the --mounted option.
  * Only use /target/bin/mount if it exists, in order to work better outside
    d-i.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Make the microsoft OS test completely case-insensative in the file and
    directory named it looks for. This is reportedly needed at least for
    Vista (Boot/BCD vs boot/bcd), and was already done on an ad-hoc basis
    for 2000/XP/NT4.0.
  * Patch from VMiklos to add support for recognising Frugalware.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Skip partitions on a physical disk that is part of a Serial ATA RAID disk.
  * Use log-output when checking for volume groups.
  * Also use the case insensitive test for Dell Utility partition detection.

  [ Fabio M. Di Nitto ]
  * Skip partitions that have the "whole_disk" sysfs attribute set.
    The kernel set the attribute for partitions like SUN Whole Disk.
    These partitions that encompass the whole disk can be mounted
    and often confused for the first partition on the disk.
    In situations where the OS is on the first partition, it would be
    detected twice in the first and the whole disk partition.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Patch from VMiklos to sed off (hdn,n) from the front of a kernel path,
    as seen in SuSE grub configs. Closes: #258623 although this is fixed
    imprefectly since it assumes stripping the string is enough.
  * Patch from VMiklos to not require an initrd be specified in the grub
    probe.
  * Patch from VMiklos to add --mounted option to linux-boot-prober.
    May not be useful for d-i but in other situations including for the
    Frugalware installer.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * When parsing a lilo configuration, dereference symbolic links. Not doing
    this will break booting the old OS if the link was in / and there was a
    separate /boot partition. And grub in general prefers full paths.
    Closes: #259825.
  * Use environment variable to pass --mounted option to lower level scripts
    instead of perpetuating the parameter.
  * Add myself to uploaders.

  * Look for partitions in /sys/block if /dev/discs isn't present.
  * Add /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL reference to debian/copyright.
  * Rename os-prober to os-prober-udeb (leaving a Provides: behind) and
    create an os-prober deb.
  * Avoid yaboot probe failing outside d-i due to archdetect being missing.
  * Don't install /var/lib/os-prober/mount in either binary package, just
    /var/lib/os-prober; the former will be created/removed on the fly
