flash-kernel (2.18) unstable; urgency=medium

  flash-kernel is now directly called by update-initramfs when updating
  the ramdisk, so the kernel postinst hook that calls flash-kernel
  is no longer necessary.  Please edit the file /etc/kernel-img.conf
  and remove the following line:
      postinst_hook = flash-kernel
  This will ensure that flash-kernel is only executed when necessary.
