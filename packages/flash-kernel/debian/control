Description: utility to make certain embedded devices bootable
 flash-kernel is a script which will make your system bootable on
 certain embedded devices that don't load the kernel and initramfs
 directly from /boot.  Traditionally, flash-kernel was meant to
 support devices that boot from flash memory (hence the name).
 Nowadays, it also has support for some devices that require a
 specific boot image on the disk.
