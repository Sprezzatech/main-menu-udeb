flash-kernel
------------

flash-kernel is a script which will take a kernel and initramfs image
and write them to MTD flash.  This is useful on a range of embedded
devices which boot from MTD flash.  You will generally want to use
this script as a post installation hook of the kernel image.  This way,
the newly installed kernel and newly created initramfs will automatically
be written to flash.  In order for this to work, you have to edit the
file /etc/kernel-img.conf and add the following line:

  postinst_hook = flash-kernel
