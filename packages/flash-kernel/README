flash-kernel
------------

flash-kernel is a script which will make your system bootable on
certain embedded devices that don't load the kernel and initramfs
directly from /boot.  Traditionally, flash-kernel was meant to
support devices that boot from flash memory (hence the name).
Nowadays, it also has support for some devices that require a
specific boot image on the disk.

You will generally want to use this script as a post installation
hook of the kernel image.  This way, the newly installed kernel and
newly created initramfs will automatically be used after you restart
your machine (either by writing it to flash memory or by constructing
a specific boot image on disk).  In order for this to work, you have
to edit the file /etc/kernel-img.conf and add the following line:

  postinst_hook = flash-kernel
