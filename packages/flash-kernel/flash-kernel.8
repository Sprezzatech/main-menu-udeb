.TH FLASH-KERNEL 8
.SH NAME
flash-kernel \- put kernel and initramfs in boot location
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B flash-kernel [--supported] [kvers]
.SH DESCRIPTION
flash-kernel is a script which will put the kernel and initramfs in
the boot location of embedded devices that don't load the kernel and
initramfs directly from /boot.  flash-kernel supports devices that
boot from flash memory (hence the name) as well as some devices that
require a special boot image on the disk.
.P
Optionally, it can be passed the version of the kernel to flash; it
defaults to flashing /vmlinuz or /boot/vmlinuz.
.P
If the --supported option is used, flash-kernel will tests to see if
the hardware is supported, and return a true or false value.
