- remove the "If you are installing from a netinst CD" thing in the
  use_mirror template and _detect_ if it's a netinst or a full CD. The
  question could also be skipped entirely for netinsts.
- http proxy asking for installs from only CD w/o choose-mirror (for
  security sources)
- multi-cd support
- If choose-mirror is run to change the mirror in the middle, it starts up
  its own progress bar and then there is no progress bar up after it
  finishes. This was worked around by disabling the progress bar in
  choose-mirror.
