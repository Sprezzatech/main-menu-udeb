- http proxy asking for installs from only CD w/o choose-mirror (for
  security sources)
- multi-cd support
- If choose-mirror is run to change the mirror in the middle, it starts up
  its own progress bar and then there is no progress bar up after it
  finishes. This was worked around by disabling the progress bar in
  choose-mirror.
- Preseeding support for updates-select (selection of security/volatile).
  Using the services can still be disabled though by setting the value for
  the respective "host" templates to empty.
