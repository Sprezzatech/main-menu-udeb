apt-setup (1:0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add strings for Ubuntu mirror generator to translation infrastructure,
    per http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2005/10/msg01407.html and
    followups.
  * Clarify apt-setup/universe description a bit.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * If setting up a mirror fails, allow the user to retry or change their
    mirror.
  * If setting up a CD fails, let the user know there was a problem instead of
    quietly continuing without a main apt source.
  * Add a comment before commented out lines to make clear why they are
    commented out.

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Break Choices in single components in templates

apt-setup (1:0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * First release as a udeb broken out from base-config and rewritten.

  * This means that apt mirror config uses d-i's mirror configs automatically.
    Closes: #220269, #252121, #235980, #251007
  * Issues with /dev/cdrom symlinks no longer apply, since that's taken
    care of by d-i. Closes: #198759, #264375, #274615
  * Issues with CD eject buttons no longer apply, since well, it currently
    only supports loading in one CD. Closes: #215639, #215639, #240331
    Closes: #333513
    (TODO item exists for multiple CDs tho).
  * Runs in the first stage so no issues with it running again and eating
    configured sources or wanting to clear proxy settings.
    Closes: #229048, #196625
  * Will deal nicely with failure to reach security.debian.org.
    Closes: #251413
  * You can enter a mirror manually in choose-mirror and entry proxy info too.
    Closes: #277481, #284794
  * CD stuff works ok in noninteractive/preseeded modes. Closes: #282356
  * Adds deb-src lines for everything, including security updates.
    Closes: #269154.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Various small fixes.
  * Call the main package apt-setup-udeb to allow for apt-setup.deb in the
    future.
  * Add translation infrastructure.
  * Set epoch to supersede the base-config-based apt-setup-udeb in Ubuntu.
  * Don't bother looking for security updates for unstable.
  * Strip everything after the first dot from generator names when
    constructing progress template names, to allow writing variants of a
    generator with the same basic purpose as the original.
  * Initial untested mirror generator for Ubuntu. Not added to translation
    infrastructure yet, although the templates are there.
