apt-setup (1:0.42) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Enable universe and multiverse by default for Ubuntu installs.
    - For Ubuntu installs, if either restricted or multiverse is enabled,
      add commented-out lines for the partner archive.
    - Use archive.ubuntu.com as the default source mirror for Ubuntu ports
      architectures.
    - Add apt-setup/proposed question (never asked); if preseeded to true
      for Ubuntu installs, -proposed entries will be added to sources.list
      (LP: #181776).
  * Adjust cancellation comment in apt-setup-verify: in-target preserves
    exit codes as of debian-installer-utils 1.70.
  * Use fetch-url instead of wget in local generator, making it possible to
    use file:// URLs.

apt-setup (1:0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't scan the installation CD if it does not include base packages.
  * Because of reported issues with accessing the CD in the /target environment
    if it is already mounted in the D-I environment, base-installer has been
    reverted to loop-mounting the installation CD. In order to still allow
    CD-changing while avoiding these issues and keeping installs idempotent, we
    now need to allow apt-cdrom to manage mounting/unmounting for all types of
    CD images (except for hd-media installs). See: #474346, #475639.
    Requires: base-installer (>= 1.90), pkgsel (>= 0.19), di-utils (>= 1.57).

  * Language tasks fit on CD3/DVD1; don't warn about missing packages from

  * Move templates for mirror use linked to installation from CD to apt-cdrom

  * Add support for CD/DVD sets during installation:
    - rename generator 50cdrom to 40cdrom to make room for new generator
    - add new generator 41cdset to support scanning additional CD/DVDs
    - add script load-install-cd
    To support CD/DVD changing, the installation CD/DVD needs to be unmounted
    in the D-I environment during package installation, which means that e.g.
    running anna-install to install udebs is no longer possible. Because of
    this components/scripts also need make sure that the installation CD is
    loaded and mounted again after package installation.
    Components/scripts that can install packages in /target after apt-setup
    has been run should either use apt-install, or create the correct
    conditions themselves (as pkgsel does).
    Requires apt (0.7.9) in testing for #448187 and #448521, and requires
    pkgsel (1.16) and di-utils (1.50).
  * Add myself as uploader.

apt-setup (1:0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * First release as a udeb broken out from base-config and rewritten.

  * This means that apt mirror config uses d-i's mirror configs automatically.
    Closes: #220269, #252121, #235980, #251007
  * Issues with /dev/cdrom symlinks no longer apply, since that's taken
    care of by d-i. Closes: #198759, #264375, #274615
  * Issues with CD eject buttons no longer apply, since well, it currently
    only supports loading in one CD. Closes: #215639, #215639, #240331
    Closes: #333513
    (TODO item exists for multiple CDs tho).
  * Runs in the first stage so no issues with it running again and eating
    configured sources or wanting to clear proxy settings.
    Closes: #229048, #196625
  * Will deal nicely with failure to reach security.debian.org.
    Closes: #251413
  * You can enter a mirror manually in choose-mirror and entry proxy info too.
    Closes: #277481, #284794
  * CD stuff works ok in noninteractive/preseeded modes. Closes: #282356
  * Adds deb-src lines for everything, including security updates.
    Closes: #269154.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Various small fixes.
  * Call the main package apt-setup-udeb to allow for apt-setup.deb in the
    future.
  * Add translation infrastructure.
  * Set epoch to supersede the base-config-based apt-setup-udeb in Ubuntu.
  * Don't bother looking for security updates for unstable.
  * Strip everything after the first dot from generator names when
    constructing progress template names, to allow writing variants of a
    generator with the same basic purpose as the original.
  * Initial untested mirror generator for Ubuntu. Not added to translation
    infrastructure yet, although the templates are there.
