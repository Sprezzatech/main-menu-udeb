_Description: Update services to use:
 Debian has two services that provide updates to releases.
 .
 security.debian.org provides security updates. Enabling this service is
 strongly recommended as it will help to keep your system secured against
 attacks.
 .
 volatile.debian.org provides updates for software that changes relatively
 frequently and where not having the lastest version could reduce the
 usability of the software. An example is the virus signatures for a virus
 scanner. This service is only available for stable and oldstable releases.
