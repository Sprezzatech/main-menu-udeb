apt-setup is used to generate an /etc/apt/sources.list for the installed
system. It does this by creating a new sources.list file (commenting out
the previous contents) and then running each program in
/usr/lib/apt-setup/generators/ in turn (run-parts ordering). Each generator
is passed the name of a temporary file that it can write sources.list lines
(and comments) to.

After the generator finishes writing the file, apt-setup-verify will be run
on it to verify that each line of the sources sources works, and it will be
added to the sources.list. If the verification fails, the sources will be
discarded. Generators can also run apt-setup-verify themselves and do their
own error recovery if it fails. apt-setup-verify tests each line of the file
and comments out lines that do not work, and exits nonzero if all apt and
apt-set lines in the file failed.

Generators should add both "apt" lines and corresponding
apt-src lines to the sources.list. apt-setup-verify will handle commenting
out any apt-src lines for unavailable sources.

Generators can ask configuration questions using debconf. To support
backing up, generators should exit with the special return code of 10 if
the user backs up from their first question. Each generator should provide
a progress bar text template named apt-setup/progress/<generator>, where
<generator> is the script's name with leading numbers removed.

Note that apt-setup and its generators may be run against some other system
in a chroot. (i.e., when installing Debian.) If apt-setup is running this
way, then ROOT will be set to the root of the chroot that it is acting on
and all sources.list validation will occur inside the chroot.
