- Handle bootkkbd=xx case
  (ie set in /proc/cmdline )

-   Read default keymap for USB (bluetooth?) keyboards, sparc

- on netinst, all console-keymap-* packages are installed.
  Try installing only the ones that are required (eg don't pull in
  console-keymaps-sun on an i386 install)

- Only install console-keymaps-at on arm arch for the appropriate
  hardware.

- Add regression test to ensure data udebs are correct
	(For space, no error checking done in this code)

- Finish template & i18n code

- Include compose maps on a per-language basis , a la Mandrake.

- Ensure that kbd-chooser can run on an installed system, not just
  when initially installing.
  ( requires cdebconf to work correctly on an installed system)

- Ask keymap question at critical priority. Experience from Ubuntu
  suggests that trying to skip this question creates too many problems
  in the long run even if you're trying to present a reduced-questions
  installation.
  (Note though that we have to be careful to not break preseeding when
   doing this, as this adds another item that would need to be preseeded
   on the boot prompt. Since we have no free slots, this cannot be done
   until after we've fixed preseeding to not need to many slots. Maybe
   after the localechooser is done, which will remove one thing from
   needing to be preseeded).
