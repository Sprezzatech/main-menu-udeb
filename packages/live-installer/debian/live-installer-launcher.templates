Description:
 "Text" and "Graphical" refer to the type of user interface - "Text"
 is character-based and operated using a keyboard, while "Graphical"
 allows the use of a mouse and supports more languages. Otherwise the
 two front ends offer what is essentially the same functionality,
 provided via the same programs.
 .
 "Expert" mode gives full control over the installation process. For
 example, if the hardware requires passing options to kernel modules as
 they are installed, you will need to start the installer in expert mode.

# Both LIVE_KERNEL and DI_KERNEL are kernel version numbers, such as
# 2.6.32-5-486, 2.6.32-5-amd64, or 2.6.32-5-powerpc etc.
Description: Live system kernel and installer kernel don't match
 The installer can only be used if the kernel versions of the live system
 (${LIVE_KERNEL}) and of the installer (${DI_KERNEL}) are the same.
 .
 Please reboot with the correct kernel (${DI_KERNEL}).
