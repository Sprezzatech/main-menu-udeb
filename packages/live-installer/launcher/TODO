In order to work properly, live-installer-launcher needs the following udebs:

  - live-installer >= 12
  - main-menu >= 1.30
  - rootskel >= 1.79

and gnome-vfs >= 1:2.24.1-3.

Bugs:

  * when exiting the installer, dev can't be unmounted properly anymore because
    it's busy, however, we do kill syslog and klog process (and when doing it
    manually, it even works). so really strange that one.

  * gui installer does not work yet

  * hal is displaying 'no permission to mount' error when target devices are
    mounted, the fdi thing is probably the way to go, however, it's somehow not
    working as it should.
