In order to work properly, live-installer-launcher needs the following udebs:

  - live-installer >= 12
  - main-menu >= 1.30
  - rootskel >= 1.79 (text), >= 1.85 (gui)
  - rootskel-gtk >= 1.20 (gui)

and gnome-vfs >= 1:2.24.1-3.

Bugs:
	- See Bug Tracking System:
	  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?src=live-installer

	- Depending on the terminal that is being used, d-i doesn't show
	  the correct colors (black/white insted of blue/red).

	- Depending on the used graphical environment, for the initial
	  installer selection, debconf-gtk etc. instead of tty debconf should
	  be used.
