* when exiting the installer, dev can't be unmounted properly anymore because
  it's busy, however, we do kill syslog and klog process (and when doing it
  manually, it even works). so really strange that one.

* gui installer does not work yet

* exit menu doesn't work wrt/ finish-installer.d, also, d-i shows bogus message
  about reboot.

* hal is displaying 'no permission to mount' error when target devices are
  mounted, the fdi thing is probably the way to go, however, it's somehow not
  working as it should.
