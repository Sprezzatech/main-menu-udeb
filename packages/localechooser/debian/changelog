localechooser (0.08) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove some cruft, avoid a hang if the iso_3166.tab is missing.
  * Fix display of questions if localechooser is re-run, which I broke
    before.
  * Make seen flags only be set on variables derived from
    debian-installer/locale if its seen flag is set, which allows for
    preseeding w/o seen flag setting to work also, but means that to avoid
    the questions lowmem must set the seen flag.
  * Clean up seen flag misuses, except for some I didn't fully understand.
  
  * Updated translations: 
    - Greek, Modern (1453-) (el.po) by Greek Translation Team
    - French (fr.po) by Christian Perrier
