These are simple utils for debian-installer:

di-utils-shell: Interactive shell. Appears in the main menu, and the
postinst does all the work. Only funny trick is we need to steal control
from debconf by grabbing back the original stdio file descriptors.

mapdevfs: Given a devfs device name, returns the name that would be used on
a non devfs system. Only works for some devices, used by eg, boot loader
installers.

anna-install: Each parameter is a udeb that anna should install. If this
command is run before anna has configured a default retriever, the udebs
will be queued for the future anna run. If it's run after a default
retriever is configured, the specified udebs will be installed immediately.

apt-install: The parameter is a deb to queue for installation into /target.
Or, if /target is already set up, the package will be installed
straightaway.

debconf-get: Prints out the value of a debconf question.

debconf-set: Sets a debconf question to a value.

register-module: Register a module to go in /etc/modules on the target.
May be called before the target is mounted. Can optionally pass parameters
that should be passed to the module on load; these are added to
/etc/modules.conf.

user-params: Output the parameters the user passed to the kernel on boot,
one per line. This should include only parameters the user entered by hand,
and will skip over parameters used to pre-seed debconf values. For any of
the user's parameters to be recognised, the kernel command line must
include "--" in it, and then all parameters after the -- are assumed to be
user input. Therefore, the installer's boot loader should pass "--" at the
end of its kernel command line to make this work.
