_Description: Setting firmware variables for automatic boot
 Some variables need to be set in the Pegasos OpenFirmware in order for
 your system to boot Debian automatically. At the end of the installation,
 the system will reboot. At the Pegasos OpenFirmware prompt, set the
 following OpenFirmware variables to enable auto-booting :
 .
  setenv boot-device ${OF_BOOT_DEVICE}
  setenv boot-file ${OF_BOOT_FILE}
  setenv auto-boot-timeout 5000
  setenv auto-boot? true
 .
 You will only need to do this once.  Afterwards, enter the "boot" command
 or reboot the system to proceed to the next Debian installation stage.
 .
 Alternatively, you will be able to boot the kernel manually with :
 .
  ${KERNEL_BOOT}
 .

_Description: Setting firmware variables for automatic boot
 Some variables need to be set in the Netwinder NeTTrom firmware in
 order for your system to boot Debian automatically.  At the end of
 this installation stage, the system will reboot, and the firmware
 will attempt to autoboot.  You can abort this by pressing any key.
 You will then be dropped into the NeTTrom command system where you
 have to execute the following commands:
 .
    setenv kernconfig fs
    setenv kerndev ${KERNDEV}
    setenv kernfile ${KERNFILE}
    setenv rootdev ${ROOTDEV}
    setenv cmdappend ${CMDAPPEND}
    save-all
 .
 You will only need to do this once.  Afterwards, enter the "boot" command
 or reboot the system to proceed to the next Debian installation stage.

_Description: No boot loader installed
 No boot loader has been installed, either because you chose not to or
 because your specific architecture doesn't support a boot loader yet.
 .
 You will need to boot manually with the ${KERNEL} kernel on partition
 ${BOOT} and ${ROOT} passed as kernel argument.
