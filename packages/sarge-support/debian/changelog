sarge-support (0.02) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Better logic for determining kernel version for mtpscsih quirk.
  * 21sarge-quirks: use /proc/modules instead of lsmod

  [ Philip Hands ]
  * Make sure that any base-config/late_command setting ends up in
    target system's debconf db.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Deal with hw-detect changes by registering some modules that probably
    will not get autoloaded on 2.6.8 systems.
