=========
CODE SETS
=========

The console fonts are named after the scheme CODESET-FONTFACE.psf,
CODESET may be Arabic, Armenian, CyrAsia, CyrKoi, CyrSlav, Ethiopian,
Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Lao, Lat15, Lat2, Lat38, Lat7, Thai, Uni1,
Uni2, Uni3 and Vietnamese. The codesets determine which symbols are
supported by the font.

Please notice that the existence of a font for a particular code set
means that the font supports only most of it.  Unfortunately some of
of the fonts support the code sets only partialy.  Please check the
support for your language.

If you need multilingual environment, take a look at the Uni1, Uni2
and Uni3 code sets.

When fonts for code sets with 512 gliphs are used in text video mode
(not framebuffer) only 8 foreground colours can be displayed.

==========
FONT FACES
==========

The following font faces are provided both for text video modes and
for framebuffer:

   Fixed13, Fixed14, Fixed15, Fixed16, Fixed18

   Goha12, Goha14, Goha16

   GohaClassic12, GohaClassic14, GohaClassic16

   Terminus14, Terminus16

   TerminusBold14, TerminusBold16

   VGA8, VGA14, VGA16

The following font faces are provided for text video modes only:

   TerminusBoldVGA14, TerminusBoldVGA16

The following font faces are provided for framebuffer video modes
only:

   Terminus12x6, Terminus20x10, Terminus24x12,
   Terminus28x14, Terminus32x16

   TerminusBold12x6, TerminusBold20x10, TerminusBold24x12,
   TerminusBold28x14, TerminusBold32x16

The numbers in the FONTFACE show the size of the font matrix.  For
example Lat2-Terminus20x10.psf is a font for codeset Lat2 with size of
the font matrix 10x20 (i.e. 10 columns and 20 rows).  If the number of
columns is 8 then only the number of rows is specified.  For example
the font matrix of Armenian-Fixed15.psf has size 8x15.

In text video mode or if you use the RadeonFB kernel module only fonts
whose font matrix has 8 columns can be used (that is the size should
be a simple NUMBER rather than a NUMBERxNUMBER combination).  The
other fonts can be used only with framebuffer video modes and with the
package 'kbd'.  The console package 'console-tools' can not be used
with such fonts.

=================
THE TERMINUS FONT
=================

The aim of the Terminus font is to reduce the eyes-fatigue when one
has to read a lot.  Currently this font supports only the Latin, the
Cyrillic and the Greek scripts (the Lat15, Lat2, Lat7, CyrAsia,
CyrKoi, CyrSlav, Greek, Uni2 and Uni3 codesets).

The fonts with font face TerminusBold and size 14 or 16 are optimized
for 8 pixels width glyph matrix (in most cases this means framebuffer).

The fonts with font face TerminusBoldVGA and size 14 or 16 are
optimized for 9 pixels width glyph matrix and can not be used with
framebuffer video modes.

The fonts with font face Terminus and size 14 or 16 can be used both
with 8 and 9 pixels width glyph matrix.

In the regular text video modes the width of the glyph matrix is 9
pixels.  If you use the package svgatextmode then the width is 8 or 9
pixels and you probably know it.

The Terminus font in this version of console-setup is version 4.26.
