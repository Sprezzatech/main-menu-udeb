Description: console font and keymap setup program
 This package provides the Linux console with the same
 keyboard configuration scheme as the X Window System. As a result,
 there is no need to duplicate or change the keyboard files just to
 make simple customizations such as the use of dead keys, the key
 functioning as AltGr or Compose key, the key(s) to switch between
 Latin and non-Latin mode, etc.
 .
 The package also contains console fonts supporting many of the
 world's languages.  It provides an unified set of font faces - the
 classic VGA, the simplistic Fixed, and the cleaned Terminus,
 TerminusBold and TerminusBoldVGA.

Description: console font and keymap setup program - reduced version
 This package provides the Linux console with the same
 keyboard configuration scheme as the X Window System. As a result,
 there is no need to duplicate or change the keyboard files just to
 make simple customizations such as the use of dead keys, the key
 functioning as AltGr or Compose key, the key(s) to switch between
 Latin and non-Latin mode, etc.
 .
 The package also contains console fonts supporting many of the
 world's languages.  It provides a unified set of font faces - the
 classic VGA, the simplistic Fixed, and the clean Terminus,
 TerminusBold, and TerminusBoldVGA.
 .
 This package can be useful for
 handhelds or other devices with small storage space.
 .
 The package supports only UTF-8. Legacy 8-bit encodings are not
 supported.

Description: font converter to generate console fonts from BDF source fonts
 This package provides a command-line converter that can be used in scripts to build
 console fonts from BDF sources automatically. The converter comes
 with a collection of font encodings that cover many of the world's
 languages. The output font can use a different character
 encoding from the input. When the source font does not define a
 glyph for a particular symbol in the encoding table, that
 glyph position in the console font is not wasted but used for
 another symbol.
 .
 When deciding about the position in the font for a particular glyph,
 the converter takes into account that in text video modes the video
 adapter copies the eighth column of the glyph matrix of symbols
 positioned in the pseudographic area to the ninth column. In order to
 create fonts for text video modes, the width of the glyph matrix of
 the source BDF font should be seven, eight, or nine pixels; otherwise the
 converter creates fonts suitable for framebuffer only.
