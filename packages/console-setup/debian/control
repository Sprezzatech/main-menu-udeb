Description: Set up the font and the keyboard on the console
 The package provides the Linux console with the same versatile
 keyboard configuration that the X Window System uses.  As a result
 there is no need to duplicate or change the keyboard files just to
 make simple customisations such as the use of dead keys, the key
 functioning as AltGr or Compose key, the key(s) to switch between
 Latin and non-Latin mode, etc.
 .
 The package also contains console fonts supporting many of the
 world's languages.  It provides an unified set of font faces - the
 classic VGA, the simplistic Fixed, and the cleaned Terminus,
 TerminusBold and TerminusBoldVGA.

Description: An experimental micro version of console-setup package
 This package can be useful when Debian system is installed on
 handhelds or other devices with small storage space.  It was created
 as proof of concept for a method to implement versatile keyboard
 configuration in the Debian installer.
 .
 This package supports only UTF-8.  The legacy 8-bit encodings are not
 supported.

Description: Font converter to generate console fonts from BDF source fonts
 This is a command line converter that can be used in scripts to build
 automatically console fonts from BDF sources.  The converter comes
 with a collection of font encodings that cover many of the world
 languages; notice that the font encoding (so called SFM) does not
 need to follow the actually used encoding (so called ACM).  When the
 source font does not define a glyph for a symbol in the font encoding
 the glyph position in the console font is not wasted but used for
 another symbol.
 .
 When deciding about the position in the font for a particular glyph,
 the converter takes into account that in text video modes the video
 adapter copies the 8th column of the glyph matrix of symbols
 positioned in the pseudographic area to the 9th column.  In order to
 create fonts for text video modes the width of the glyph matrix of
 the source BDF font should be 7, 8 or 9 pixels, otherwise the
 converter creates fonts suitable for framebuffer only.
