console-setup (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add a manual page for ckbcomp.  Thanks to Vassilis Pandis,
    closes: #405005. 
  * Apply a patch by Colin Watson:
    - enable udebs;
    - remove unhelpful defaults for several questions;
    - allow preseeding of console-setup/modelcode,
      console-setup/layoutcode, console-setup/variantcode,
      console-setup/optionscode, and console-setup/fontsize;
    - remove outdated note about loadkeys in console-setup-udeb's
      description;
    - Add a few bits of installer integration to console-setup-udeb
      borrowed from kbd-chooser. 
    I disabled the code for making UTF-8 default charmap in d-i because
    there are locales which use other charmap.  However I made setupcon to
    always use UTF-8 in d-i environment.
  * Updated French and Dutch translations, new Portuguese.  Thanks to
    Pedro Ribeiro, Jean-Luc Coulon and Bart Cornelis.

  * Thanks to Colin Watson and Ubuntu team for the many bugs and
    improvements fixed in this release.  Patches were provided by Colin
    Watson:
    - Do not sorce the debconf library in the middle of the postinst,
      closes: #420831.
    - Remove from the source package several directories
      debian/UDEB-PACKAGE-NAME.  (The udebs were removed from
      debian/control before running the clean target.)  Closes: #420912.
    - Map fr_CH locale to Swiss French default keyboard
      layout in config.proto.  Closes: #420828.
    - Pass xkbdir variable on the make-command line, because else its
      value is overriden and the keymap definitions in Keyboard/ckb are
      used.  Closes: #420827.
    - A new option --save-only for setupcon.
    - Ship KeyboardNames.pl and kbdnames-maker.  Closes: #420914.
    - Fix Esperanto locale check in config.proto, closes: #420785.  Make
      'epo' the default layout for Esperanto.

      Closes: #420802.

      keyboards.  Override the keyboard model if it was chosen by default
      and the layout is Japanese or Brasilian.  Closes: #420824.

    Thanks to Karsten Hilbert, closes: #421796.
  * Two additions to the FAQ:

      Semyonov, closes: #402143.
    - Document CapsLock working as ShiftLock in Unicode mode.
  * Added manual page for setupcon.  Thanks to Vassilis Pandis,

  * Remove the udebs in order to make the migration from unstable to
    testing automatic.
  * Update the version of the Terminus font from 4.16 to 4.20.  (This is

  * Fix two problems reported by Martin-Éric Racine.  Closes: #393850.

console-setup (1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * setupcon: new option --force to skip the 'are we on the console'
    check.  To be used for d-i because there /proc/self/fd/2 points to
    pipe.  Thanks to Tollef Fog Heen.

    available.  Thanks to Colin Watson for the bug report and the patch,
    closes: #386835.

    corresponding Debconf questions with medium instead of critical
    priority.  Thanks to Colin Watson, closes: #386836.
  * config.proto(ask_debconf): when the provided default value is
    unavailable, try to use the empty string.  Useful when asking for the
    keyboard variant.

    Martin-Éric Racine, closes: #386545.

  * Added Czech translation. Closes: #360333

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Keyboard/ckbcomp: include /usr/share/X11/xkb to the list of

    0.8-5.  Update ckbcomp with two new keysyms (Cyrillic_(CHE|KA)_vertbar).

  [ Anton Zinoviev ]
  * Few comments in debian/templates.
  * Document in console-setup/fontsize-fb template that non 8-pixel wide
    fonts can not be used with console-tools.  Add a warning in setupcon
    if the user tries to use such fonts with console-tools.  Thanks to
    Hans Ulrich Niedermann, closes: #352911.
  * debian/postinst: protect in double quotes the variables read from
    $CONFIGFILE.  Thanks to Jonas Meurer, closes: #353525.

    hexadecimal numbers.  Thanks to Bálint Balogh, closes: #354564.

console-setup (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix some bugs related to non-UTF8 modes:
    - setupcon always sets up the first console in UTF-8 mode
    - setupcon doesn't load ACM in the first console if kbd is used 
    - ckbcomp has to interpret the "acute" Xkeysym as apostrophe.
    Thanks to Norbert Preining, closes: #352449.

 -- Anton Zinoviev <zinoviev@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Feb 2006 21:37:42 +0200

console-setup (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run setupcon in postinst.  Thanks to Recai Oktaş for the suggestion.
  * Setupcon uses /proc/self/fd/2 (standard error) instead of
    /proc/self/fd/0 (standard output) in order to determine whether we are
    on the console or not.  That way setupcon can detect that we are on
    the console even when it is invoked from postinst and Debconf has
    changed standard input and output.
  * Changes in the text of some questions: "What is the origin of our
    keyboard" instead of "What is the layout of your keyboard" and "What
    is the layout of your keyboard" instead of "What is the variant of
    your keyboard".  Ask the console-setup/variant question with critical
    priority.  Thanks to Arnt Karlsen, closes: #352405.
  * Fix the true/yes discrepancy in setupcon which caused the options -k
    and -f not to work.
  * Updated Bulgarian translation.
