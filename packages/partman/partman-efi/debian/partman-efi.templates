_Description: In order to start your new Debian system, the firmware on your Itanium system loads the boot loader from its private EFI partition on the hard disk.  The boot loader then loads the operating system from that same partition.  An EFI partition has a FAT16 filesystem formatted on it and the bootable flag set. Most installations place the EFI partition on the first primary partition of the same hard disk that holds the root filesystem.
