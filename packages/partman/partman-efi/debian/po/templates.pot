"In order to start your new system, the firmware on your Itanium system loads "
"the boot loader from its private EFI partition on the hard disk.  The boot "
"loader then loads the operating system from that same partition.  An EFI "
"partition has a FAT16 file system formatted on it and the bootable flag set. "
"Most installations place the EFI partition on the first primary partition of "
"the same hard disk that holds the root file system."
