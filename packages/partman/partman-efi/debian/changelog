partman-efi (2) UNRELEASED; urgency=high

  * Jim Lieb
    - Don't disable swap after formatting
    - Set svn:executable on various files
    - Reduce commit.d/_numbers from 51 to 50 to conform with others
    - force bootable for fat filesystems used for efi
  * Christian Perrier
    - Rename templates file
  * dann frazier
    - Uploading with high priority, since partman-efi would be loaded but
      wouldn't run w/o Jim's changes.

partman-efi (1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Jim Lieb
    - Initial release
    - use partman-palo as template and create same for EFI boot partitions
      that are found on ia64 systems and x86 systems with EFI BIOS
    - Translations are a simple global substitute i.e. s/palo/efi/g
  * dann frazier
    - Uploading with high urgency as not having this package will result
      in users reaching the end of an install w/o having created an EFI
      partitioning, which will cause the boot loader install to fail.
