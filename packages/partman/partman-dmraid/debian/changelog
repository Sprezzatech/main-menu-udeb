partman-dmraid (2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Change priority to optional as the udeb is supposed to be loaded by
    disk-detect only when Serial ATA RAID is detected.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Remove unnecessary test.

  [ Max Vozeler ]
  * Replace code to commit partman changes to disk with
    call to commit_changes from partman-base (>= 113) and
    version the dependency accordingly.
