- support for using all available free space for lvm is broken according to
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/partman-auto-lvm/+bug/21242
  and has been removed until it can be fixed

- before creating new partitions on the disk, we need to check if there are
  older lvm stuff on the disk and wipe it away or ask the user if we can wipe it,
  otherwise the result is "interesting".
