partman-auto-lvm (25) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Lock devices that are used for physical volumes, as is done when setting
    up LVM using manual partitioning. Requires: partman-lvm (>= 58).
  * auto-lvm.sh: avoid double sourcing of base.sh.
  * auto-lvm.sh: call device_cleanup_partitions() to ensure we remove obsolete
    partition info after committing changes. Requires: partman-base (>= 115).

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Don't emit partman-auto-lvm/no_boot if / is outside LVM (e.g. a system
    with the operating system on a relatively small plain block device and a
    large LVM area for services). Reported by Nick Moffitt.

partman-auto-lvm (3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Changed dependency from partman to partman-base.

  [ Fabio M. Di Nitto ]
  * Rename new_VG to VG_create (name more similar to vgcreate).
  * Avoid useless loop in VG_create.
  * Rename detach_PV to VG_reduce.
  * Rename attach_PV to VG_extend.
  * Rename new_LV to LV_create.
  * Rename delete_LV to LV_remove.
  * Flush udev queue in vg_all_free/do_option otherwise the devices might
    not be there yet.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Use log-output.
  * Merge remainder of Ubuntu patches from Fabio and Colin. Some manual
    merging due to other changes and the patch including some of the
    changes listed above. The other changes in this patch follow.

  [ Colin Watson ]
   * Disable ourselves on powerpc (closes: Ubuntu #14438).
   * Disable ourselves on powerpc in a slightly more effective way.

  [ Fabio M. Di Nitto ]
   * Add 40 some_device_lvm based on partman-auto counterpart.
   NOTE: all the next changes will make partman-auto-lvm useful only with
   lvm2 and the lvm_tools.sh API rename is done to keep a bit of consistency
   with what real lvm2 tools actually do.
   * Use vgs to simplify VG_list (lvm_tools.sh).
   * Use pvs to simplify VG_of_PV.
   * Simplify VG_reduce.
   * Implement the "full" option in LV_create.
   * Cleanup LV_list.
   NOTE: the following change requires partman-auto-41ubuntu3 or higher.
   * Use expand_scheme and clean_method from recipe.sh to remove duplicate
     code.
   * expand_scheme needs a valid free_size value to return a proper $scheme
     back. Also note the size hack in perform_recipe_by_lvm due to lvm
     rounding issues. In order to fill up the space, the last partition will
     be created using all the free_size and a 3% of the overall space is
     reserved to ensure that the last partition is big enough.
     There might be better methods to calculate, but right now this one seems
     to fullfil its task.
   * Map devfs names to real devices in vg_all_free/do_option since lvm2
     tools don't like devfs names.
   * Create a separate /boot and a vg on the selected device.
   * Allign vg creation between vg_all_free and some_device_lvm.
   * Add notes on scheme manipulation.
   * Remove wrong call to clean_method in perform_recipe_by_lvm.
   * Fix device mapper naming.
   * Restart partman at the end of the process. This is required to get some
     LVM info right.
   * Add missing noheadings to LV_create.
   * Strip the decimal in LV_create.
   * Try to give more sensible names to partitions that are not mounted.
   * Add db_progress info to perform_recipe_by_lvm.
   * Fix partition size calculation using kbytes instead of Mbytes.
     This operation removes any weird hack in calculating the partitions.
   * brownpaper bag.. it's ok to switch to kbytes.. but not everything can
     handle so big numbers.
   * Remove "Use free space option".
     (see http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=15017)

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add lvm2-udeb to deps since this now needs lvm2
  * Version dependency on partman-auto due to above changes.
  * Remove currently dead code for vg_all_free, and add TODO so we don't
    forget to try to fix it sometime.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Use 'rm -f' rather than more awkward test-then-remove constructions.
  * Use stop_parted_server and restart_partman functions from partman-base
    73 instead of duplicating the code.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Use gpt instead of msdos disklabel for disks larger than 2TB.
