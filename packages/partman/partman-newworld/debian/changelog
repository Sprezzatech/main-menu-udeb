partman-newworld (5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Clarify partman-newworld/no_newworld text a little.
    - Load the hfs module during initialization.
    - Add a valid_filesystems script for newworld again, so that partitions
      are properly created as hfs (closes: #246841).
    - Talk about "819200 bytes" rather than the confusing "820KB" (see
      #248116).

partman-newworld (3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Anton Zinoviev
    - changelog: add local variable "coding" for Emacs
    - choose_method/_numbers: renumber the newworld method (20->45).
      The other method numbers in partman currently are format (20),
      keep and reuse (30), swap area (40), lvm (50), do not use (70).
    - templates:
       1. change the required size for yaboot partition (800KB->820KB).
          This is because partman measures sizes using metric multipliers
          and 800KB means 800000B rather than 819200B
       2. add partman/method_long/newworld and partman/method_short/newworld
    - new file update.d/newworld_visuals: give value of the field for file
      system in the main partitioning menu
    - update.d/newworld:
       1. rename as newworld_sync_flag
       2. remove the unnecessary hack at the end of the file
       3. read the flags from parted_server only when we have to change
          the state of boot flag (the scripts in update.d have to be as
          fast as possible)
       4. unset the boot flag of non-newworld partitions made bootable by
          partman-newworld
    - remove valid_filesystem directory and its contents: this hack is no
      more necessary
  * Colin Watson
    - Bump priority to standard now that Anton's reviewed it.
    - Add filesystem_long and filesystem_short descriptions of HFS.
