partman-ext2r0 (0.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * New package partman-ext2r0 based on partman-ext3 which adds support
    for the ext2 revision 0 file system needed by some old boot loaders
    to boot from (e.g. on MIPS based Cobalt and some ARM based Netwinder
    machine).
  * Martin Michlmayr
    - Put this file system after more important file systems in the list,
      but before FAT.
    - Use /boot as the default mount point.
    - Make the package arch: arm mipsel and only provide it for
      arm/netwinder and mipsel/cobalt.
