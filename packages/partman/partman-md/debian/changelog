    - raid1 works for root (or /boot) with raid1, of course does not with
      raid0. Remove the big scarey warning, though we really need a new one
      about raid0 and some other raid levels.

    - Sync changes from Anton Zinoviev made in partman-lvm (15), namely:
      - in the confirmation dialog say which partitions are going to be
        formatted.  (See #247343)
      - init.d/lvm: inform parted_server for whether the newly created
        partition contains some file system; use the command "open_dialog
        DISK_UNCHANGED" to inform parted_server that the newly created loop
        "partition table" and partition do not exist only in the internal
        data structures of libparted, but are real. (See #247780)
       closes: #249153
    - Only prompt about writing changes to disk when there actually
      are any changes.  Closes: #250971
