_Description: Continue with partitioning?
 This partitioner doesn't have information about the default type of
 the partition tables on your architecture.  Please send an e-mail
 message to debian-boot@lists.debian.org with information.
 .
 Please note that if the type of the partition table is unsupported by
 libparted, then this partitioner will not work properly.

Template: partman/unsupported_label
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Continue with partitioning?
 This partitioner is based on the library libparted which doesn't have
 support for the partition tables used on your architecture.  It is
 strongly recommended that you exit this partitioner.
 .
 If you can, please help to add support for your partition table type
 to libparted.

Type: boolean

_Description: Create new empty partition table on this device?
 You have selected an entire device to partition. If you proceed with
 creating a new partition table on the device, then all current partitions
 will be removed.
 .
 Note that you will be able to undo this operation later if you wish.

Template: partman/confirm_write_new_label
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Write a new empty partition table?
 Because of limitations in the current implementation of the Sun
 partition tables in libparted, the newly created partition table has
 to be written to the disk immediately.
 .
 You will NOT be able to undo this operation later and all existing
 data on the disk will be irreversibly removed.
 .
 Confirm whether you actually want to create a new partition table and
 write it to disk.

Template: partman/confirm
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Write these changes to disk?
 If you continue, these changes to the partition table will be
 written to disk.
 .
 WARNING: This will destroy all data on any partitions you have
 removed as well as on the partitions on which you have chosen to
 create new file systems.
 .
