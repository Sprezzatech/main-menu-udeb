_Description: 
 Partitioning a hard drive consists of logically dividing it to
 create the space needed to install your new Debian system.  You need
 to choose which partition(s) will be used for the installation of
 Debian.
 .
 Select a free space to create partitions in it.
 .
 Select a device to remove all partitions in it and create a new empty
 partition table.
 .
 Select a partition to remove it or to specify how Debian is going to
 use it.  At a bare minimum, Debian needs one partition to contain the
 root of the file system (whose mount point is /).  Most people also
 feel that a separate swap partition is a necessity.  "Swap" is
 scratch space for an operation system, which allows the system to use
 disk storage as "virtual memory".
 .
 When the partition is already formatted you may choose to keep and
 use the existing data in the partition.  Partitions that will be used
 in this way are marked with "${KEEP}" in the main partitioning menu.
 NOTE: this installer doesn't allow you to install over an existing
 GNU/Linux system overwriting files.
 .
 In general you will want to format the partition with newly created
 file system.  NOTE: all data in the partition will be irreversibly
 deleted.  If you decide to format a partition that is already
 formatted, it will be marked with "${DESTROY}" in the main
 partitioning menu.  Otherwise it will be marked with "${FORMAT}".

_Description: In order to start your new Debian system, a so called boot loader is used.  It can be installed either in the master boot record of the first hard disk, or in a partition.  When the boot loader is installed in a partition then you must set the bootable flag for it. Such a partition will be marked with "${BOOTABLE}" in the main partitioning menu.
