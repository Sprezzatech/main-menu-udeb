  * Do not run partman-auto on S/390. Main reason is that S/390 installations
    will mostly use multiple disks. As partman-auto currently only supports
    partitioning a single disk, running it is not very useful.

partman-auto (51) unstable; urgency=low

  * Also set free_type in wipe_disk as that is needed by the function
    create_primary_partitions. This allows partman-auto-lvm to actually create
    the /boot partition as a primary partition.
  * Allow to include definitions of partitions in regular recipes that should
    only be used for a certain type of auto partitioning. This is useful to
    allow e.g. a definition for a /boot partition to be included that is not
    to be used for regular auto partitioning, but is needed for auto-lvm.
    The actual implementation is in reverse as that seems more flexible: a
    partition can be marked using "$<type>ignore" (where <type> is default or
    lvm) and will then not be included. Multiple ignore marks are possible.
    To implement this, the functions choose_recipe and decode_recipe now take
    an extra argument indicating the type of autopartitioning being done.
  * Add myself to uploaders.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Renamed multi_user scheme to just "multi" as in multiple partitions.
    There are more uses for this scheme than multi user systems.
  * Switch package to arch all and only include recipes for the given
    architecture and any subarches in each package.
  * Rules file cleanups.
  * Control file cleanups.
  * Change descriptions of home and multi recipes to just list the partitions
    that are included. Closes: #287409, #288884
  * Increase minimal size of / partition in home recipe to 500 mb.
    Closes: #289419, #330079
  * Double the weight of the root partition in the multi scheme from 400 to
    800. This should increase the size allocated on reasonable size disks
    from the previous 250 mb to something slightly more reasonable.
    Closes: #328514

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * Add a smalldisk recipe for alpha, so that systems with little disk space
    can use a single ext2 partition for the whole install (closes: #261182).

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Remove duplicated chrp_rs6k recipes and install a symlink instead.

  [ Fabio M. Di Nitto ]
  * Start implementing bits required to avoid code duplication with
    partman-auto-lvm as per discussion on debian-boot mailing list.
    (See http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2005/10/msg00842.html)
  * Add lvmok{ } to recipes as per discussion on debian-boot mailing list.
    NOTES:
      - nobody objected to a tag/properties/flag name or proposed something
        different. It is clearly ok to rename it if it doesn't fit.
      - swap will stay out of LVM for now. In some cases it is known to break
        suspend/resume. It seems not all kernels are able to resume from it.
      - porters will have to adjust their recipes. I could only test
        i386/amd64 (via recipes) and powerpc-powermac_newworld (via
        recipes-powerpc-powermac_newworld).
  * Move common code into auto-shared.sh shelllib and create 3 functions:
    wipe_disk, create_primary_partitions (see comments in the file) and
    create_partitions.
  * Install auto-shared.sh in /lib/partman (chages debian/rules)
  * Make perform_recipe and autopartition use auto-shared.sh.
  * Make create_partitions set a var for all the devices that will be marked
    as pv. This is actually only used by partman-auto-lvm, but it is generic
    enough that could be used later on for other tasks.
    NOTES: the above changes have been tested on i386/amd64/ppc and there is
    no known breakage. The code is only moved around and none of the actual
    recipes use method{ lvm } used by partman-auto-lvm to mark partitions as
    pv volumes.

        1. create files `use_filesystem' in partition directories with
           assigned file system
        2. linux-swap is not a file system but method
