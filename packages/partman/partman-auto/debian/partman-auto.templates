 small to be automatically partitioned.

Template: partman-auto/autopartitioning_failed

_Description: Partitioning method:
 The installer can guide you through partitioning a disk (using different
 standard schemes) or, if you prefer, you can do it manually. With guided
 partitioning you will still have a chance later to review and customise
 the results.
 .
 If you choose guided partitioning for an entire disk, you will next be
 asked which disk should be used.

Template: partman-auto/purge_lvm_from_device
Type: boolean

_Description: Remove existing logical volume data?
 The selected device already contains the following LVM logical volumes,
 volume groups and physical volumes which are about to be removed:
 .
 Logical volume(s) to be removed: ${LVTARGETS}
 .
 Volume group(s) to be removed: ${VGTARGETS}
 .
 Physical volume(s) to be removed: ${PVTARGETS}
