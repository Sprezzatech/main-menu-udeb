_Description: Partitioning method:
 This installer can guide you through partitioning a disk for use by

Template: partman-auto/purge_lvm_from_device
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Remove all logical volume data?
 The selected device already contains logical volumes and/or
 volume groups from a previous LVM installation, which must be removed
 from the disk before creating any partitions.

Template: partman-auto/cannot_purge_lvm_from_device
Type: error
_Description: LVM physical volume already exists on the selected device
 The selected device already contains one or more LVM physical
 volumes which cannot be removed. It is therefore not possible to
 automatically partition this device.
