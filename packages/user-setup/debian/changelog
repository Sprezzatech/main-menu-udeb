user-setup (0.04) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL reference to debian/copyright.
  * Add a primitive user-setup.deb, to replace the old 'dpkg-reconfigure
    passwd.config'; may be of some use in live CD-style environments.
  * Rename user-setup to user-setup-ask to make room for a user-setup
    wrapper script in the .deb.

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Call commands using [a-z] intervals under a C locale
    Closes: #343636

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Exit 10 on backup out of the program, to work properly with main-menu.

user-setup (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Christian Perrier ]
  * Add the first created user to useful groups (code coming
    from base-config)
  * log all calls to adduser

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Fix setpassword: perl is already run in the chroot, so there's no need
    to try to chroot again.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Add po/output file to ensure utf-8 encoding.
