  * Rework initramfs templates, remove the clumsy "initramfs initrd"
    construct; the fact that it's an initramfs is essentially an
    implementation detail that users do not need to worry about.

  * Move post install hooks to run after debootstrap but before the
    installation of the kernel and other extra packages. This allows
    this hook to be used for preseeding packages installed after debootstrap.
  * Avoid crashing the postinst if arch_get_kernel_flavour fails, this better
    supports the case of some unknown subarch since later tests will result
    in a warning message being shown to the user about there being no usable
    kernel.
  * Add guards around uses of FLAVOUR in case above change makes it be empty

  * Remove mkinitrd.conf hacking code that worked around bugs in the woody
    version, not supported by this version of d-i.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Support defining multiple prefered kernel versions. This allows
    base-installer to install a kernel-image meta package even if the first
    preference is not available.

  * Force APT::Authentication::TrustCDROM to true so that apt 0.6.42 will
    install from Debian CDs again.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Re-implement the use of log-output using the new version written in C.
  * Remove hard-coded redirection to /var/log/messages in run-debootstrap so
    that log-output in the postinst can do its work.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove code that munged/demunged Packages and Release filename in the
    cache for debootstrap, since debootstrap no longer does that munging.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Use a cdrom: source line in apt instead of a file: source line to make
    apt's TrustCDROM option actually work. Make sure sources.list is empty
    before running apt-cdrom.
  * Make sure that neither apt-cdrom or apt unount/mount CD-ROMs; needed to
    make cdrom: source lines also work with CD images.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Display fallback warning messages as using an error template instead
    of in the progress bar, since they can be arbitrarily bad. Warnings that
    have a template (ie, the download retry warning) still display as progress
    bar updates.
  * Delete any cruft left behind by a past debootstrap run in
    /target/var/lib/apt. This avoids a problem where 1) debootstrap is run
    before dinstall 2) Packages file download fails and aborts the run 3)
    debootstrap is re-run after dinstall, does not refresh Release file, and
    fails since the new Packages file it does download has a m5sum mismatch
    with the old Release file. (Ah, the joys of running d-i on dialup..)

  [ Sven Luther ]
  * Adapted to chrp_rs6k -> chrp_ibm migration.

  * Fix code to avoid -smp variants on powerpc64.
  * Support configuring initramfs-tools rather than initrd-tools, and make
    that the default when installing 2.6. We still use initrd-tools on hppa
    and ia64, as the most current information I have indicates that
    initramfs-tools doesn't work there; porters should feel free to update
    this. I've left notes for where I think yaird could best be slotted in.
  * Allow extra packages to be installed along with init*-tools, controlled
    by base-installer/kernel/linux/extra-packages* templates. This allows
    derivatives to install initramfs hooks such as usplash.

    - Update arch_get_kernel_flavour() for ia64 so that it keys off of

    - Added progress and info templates for new debootstrap for downrelsig,
      downmainpkgs, releasesig, validrelsig, resolvebase, resolvereq,
      and checkingsizes. Did not bother with newbase, newrequired, and
      redundantbase since they're more like debugging messages.

      which are not used by debootstrap 0.3.1 anymore.
    - Improve run-debootstrap's warning handling, display warning on progress
      bar. However, this is untested, since debootstrap's warning code is

base-installer (1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  NOTE: not for sarge, needs rootskel 1.11
  * Colin Watson
    - Bump kernel defaults to 2.4.27-2 and 2.6.8-2 for i386, ia64, and s390.
      hppa is still trailing behind at 2.6.8-1.
    - Use major version of target kernel rather than installation kernel to
      work out whether to use an initrd or (on powerpc) to run mkvmlinuz.
    - Parameterise access to files in /proc by kernel/*.sh, allowing the
      test suite to run without sudo access or a chroot. 'make test' in
      kernel/ should be easily runnable by everyone now.
    - If run with TEST_VERBOSE=0, the test suite produces no output except
      on errors.
    - kernel/tests/runtests and 'make test' in kernel/ exit non-zero on
      errors.
    - Run test suite automatically on package build.
    - Install kernel-latest-powerpc metapackages.
  * Matt Kraai
    - Fix the spelling of "file system".
  * Steve Langasek
    - Bump kernel defaults to 2.4.27-2 for alpha, and to 2.6.8-2 for hppa.
    - Update kernel test directory to match.
  * Sven Luther
    - 2.4.27-3 powerpc kernel now produces only one kernel-image-2.4.27-powerpc
      package, so dropped the pmac/chrp/chrp-rs6k/prep handling from
      kernel/powerpc.sh.
    - Removed mkvmlinuz explicit install, as all kernel-images (2.4.27-3,
      2.6.8-11 and 2.6.10-3) now depend on mkvmlinuz.
  * Christian Perrier

  * Colin Watson
    - Merge experimental kernel selection improvements branch:
      + Consolidate all the uname calls to find the kernel version into one
        place.
      + Split per-architecture kernel handling out of the postinst into one
        script per architecture, with an interface to the postinst that
        allows base-installer to pick a usable kernel even if the one it
        actually wants isn't on the CD. See kernel/README.
      + Add a test suite for kernel selection. See kernel/tests/README.
      + Make sure all the kernels displayed in
        base-installer/kernel/which-kernel are usable.
    - Use chrp 2.4 kernel on all powerpc chrp* subarchitectures, even
      chrp-rs6k. The chrp-rs6k 2.4 kernel is to be removed.
    - Fix arch_get_kernel output on s390, and explicitly disallow -s390-tape
      and -s390x (documenting why).
    - Map lasat subarchitecture to r5k-lasat flavour on mipsel.
    - Rename debian-installer/kernel/* to base-installer/kernel/*.

    - In kernel version fallback code, try to find a kernel on the list with
      the same major version as the installer's kernel, and use it. It's
      better to use 2.4.26 instead of 2.4.25 than to fall forward to the
