lowmem (1.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Add Sylvain Ferriol's lowmem level patch.
    - Modifed to store the level in /var/lib/lowmem. Level 1 is default
      lowmem mode, level 2 is super lowmem mode. The file still doesn't exist
      in non-lowmem mode.
    - Documented this.
    - Add error message if the machine doesn't have even the minimum
      supported memory. Closes: #266984

lowmem (1.01) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bastian Blank
    - Move script into startup code to follow rootskel changes. Needs rootskel
      0.89.
  * Joey Hess
    - Patch from Bubulle to hack in non-removal of -en "translations".
      Closes: #245166

    - Increase userspace RAM trigger for mips to 33 MB.

lowmem (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Martin Michlmayr
    - Before running the "kill" command, check whether there is actually
      any suitable "tail" process to kill; otherwise the postinst will
      fail when there is no such process which is always the case in
      serial console installs and might be the case when the postinst
      is run twice.  Closes: #260949
    - Also, be super cautious and use kill $pid || true because there
      is the possibilty for a race occuring; thanks, Joey Hess.
    - Increase needed ram on mipsel from 25 to 33: installations on
      Cobalt machines without lowmem do not work with 32 MB but work
      with 36 MB, so enable lowmem when less than 36 MB are found.
      (Machines with 35 MB RAM are shown to have 32, 32 MB are shown
      as 29, so pick 33 for needed ram.)

lowmem (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes for when countrychooser is not installed, as in a floppy install,
    and for general robustness if other debconf questions are missing.
    Closes: #260628

lowmem (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move the stuff in S31lowmem to S10lowmem, so it runs before the code that
    decides whether to enable framebuffer. I think this code moved during
    recent rootskel changes.

    - To be compliant with the previous trimtemplates in shell,
      trimtemplates can have directory or file as argument.

    - Converted to use MemTotal, which will work with thre 2.4 and 2.6
      kernels.
    - Don't crash the boot process if the free memory cannot be detected.
