Default: true
_Description: Load CD-ROM drivers from a driver floppy?
 No common CD-ROM drive was detected.
 .
 You may need to load additional CD-ROM drivers from a driver floppy.
 If you have such a floppy available now, put it in the drive, and
 continue. Otherwise, you will be given the option to manually select
 CD-ROM modules.

Template: cdrom-detect/manual_config
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Manually select a CD-ROM module and device?
 No common CD-ROM drive was detected.
 .
 Your CD-ROM drive may be an old Mitsumi or another non-IDE, non-SCSI
 CD-ROM drive. In that case you should choose which module to load and
 the device to use. If you don't know which module and device are
 needed, look for some documentation or try a network installation
 instead of a CD-ROM installation.

Template: cdrom-detect/retry
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Try again to mount the CD-ROM?
 Your installation CD-ROM couldn't be mounted. This probably means that
 the CD-ROM was not in the drive. If so you can insert it and try again.

Template: cdrom-detect/cdrom_module
Type: select
Choices: ${choices}
Default: none
_Description: Module needed for accessing the CD-ROM:
 The automatic detection didn't find a CD-ROM drive. You can try to
 load a specific module if you have a unusual CD-ROM drive (that is
 neither IDE nor SCSI).

Template: cdrom-detect/cdrom_device
Type: string
Default: /dev/cdrom
_Description: Device file for accessing the CD-ROM:
 In order to access your CD-ROM drive, please enter the device file that
 should be used. Non-standard CD-ROM drives use non-standard device
 files (such as /dev/mcdx).
 .
 You may switch to the shell on the second terminal (ALT+F2) to check the
 available devices in /dev with "ls /dev". You can return to this screen
 by pressing ALT+F1.

Template: cdrom-detect/success
Type: note
_Description: CD-ROM detected
 The CD-ROM autodetection was successful. A CD-ROM drive has been found and it
 currently contains the CD ${cdname}. The installation will now continue.

Template: cdrom-detect/failure
Type: error
_Description: Failed to find and mount a Debian CD-ROM
 You may be able to install Debian without a CD-ROM, by using an alternate
 source such as a network.

Template: cdrom-detect/wrong-cd
Type: error
_Description: Non-Debian CD-ROM detected
 The CD-ROM drive contains a non-Debian CD.

Template: mirror/suite
Type: select
_Choices: stable, testing, unstable
_Description: Debian version to install:
 Debian comes in several flavors. Stable is well-tested and rarely changes.
 Unstable is untested and frequently changing. Testing is a middle ground,
 that receives many of the new versions from unstable if they are not too
 buggy.
