* do other sorts of network configurations (pcmcia, ppp)

* pppconfig would be a good starting point for the ppp udeb.  There is also an
  example in there of how to use pppd to detect a modem.

* Make netcfg-static smarter about default values, e.g. call ifconfig and
  parse.

* find a smart way to affirm that the network is functional

* allow user to abort network configuration completely (have the postinst
  exit w/ a successful status though)

* allow user option to reconfigure with static IP, reconfigure wireless,
  or retry DHCP without sacrificing UI usability
