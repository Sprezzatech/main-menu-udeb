kickseed (0.7) hoary; urgency=low

  * Extra preseed for new Ubuntu keymap selector.
  * Implement ksdevice= to set the network interface used by netcfg.
  * Add support for ks=hd:<device>:/<file> to read a Kickstart file from a
    vfat or ext2 partition on an arbitrary device (although actually some
    other filesystems will probably work too). Requires anna 1.06ubuntu5.
  * Split out /proc/cmdline handling into /lib/kickseed/cmdline.sh.

kickseed (0.6) hoary; urgency=low

  * Merge file-kickseed and network-kickseed into initrd-kickseed. If
    reading a Kickstart file from CD-ROM or the network, install (using
    anna) and configure (using udpkg) the appropriate udebs first in order
    to make sure that the requested file is accessible.

kickseed (0.5) hoary; urgency=low

  * Add a network-kickseed package to allow downloading Kickstart files from
    the network (only HTTP so far).
  * Make packages that use /usr/share/debconf/confmodule depend on
    cdebconf-udeb.

kickseed (0.4) hoary; urgency=low

  * Make zerombr a no-op rather than dying.
  * Fix clearpart --initlabel.
  * "Implement" firewall --disabled/--disable.
  * Implement cdrom (a no-op, assuming that everyone using this will be
    booting with the cdrom initrd).
  * Implement clearpart --all, assuming for now that this means just the
    first disk; getting partman-auto to deal with multiple disks appears to
    be difficult. I'm not sure if this will work properly with e.g. USB
    installs.
  * Add a file-kickseed package to allow loading Kickstart files from CD-ROM
    or floppy disk.

kickseed (0.3) hoary; urgency=low

  * Implement langsupport.
  * Implement skipx properly (by not starting the display manager).
  * Implement rootpw --iscrypted.

kickseed (0.2) hoary; urgency=low

  * Add Standards-Version: field.
  * Force debconf priority to critical.
  * Implement 'timezone', having fixed base-config to make timezone
    preseeding easier.

kickseed (0.1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Initial release. This is still very experimental, doesn't implement all
    of Kickstart, is probably unable to do a completely automated
    installation yet, and can only read Kickstart files from the initrd.
    Nevertheless, it works as far as it goes.
