kickseed (0.35) dapper; urgency=low

  * Preseed passwd/root-login depending on whether the root password is
    disabled, to cope with user-setup 1.1.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 15 May 2006 15:08:53 +0100

kickseed (0.34) dapper; urgency=low

  * setup/hd: Install disk-detect rather than hw-detect-full.
  * Adapt %packages handling to pkgsel.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 12 Jan 2006 22:50:32 +0000

kickseed (0.33) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix %packages handling to account for names in aptitude patterns really
    being unanchored regular expressions.
  * Update crypted user and root password handling for passwd 1:4.0.13-5.
    This is incompatible with older versions of passwd.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 11 Dec 2005 10:34:13 +0000

kickseed (0.32) dapper; urgency=low

  * Use log-output so that log messages go to syslog and are tagged as
    coming from kickseed.
  * Simplify prebaseconfig script.
  * Remove Standards-Version:, not applicable to udebs.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 27 Oct 2005 12:44:49 +0100

kickseed (0.31) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add "Ubuntu Standard" and "Kubuntu Standard" package groups, which
    install the ubuntu-standard and kubuntu-standard tasks respectively.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri,  7 Oct 2005 16:38:07 +0100

kickseed (0.30) breezy; urgency=low

  * Fix NFS mount error dialog.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon,  8 Aug 2005 18:29:31 +0100

kickseed (0.29) breezy; urgency=low

  * Update timezone to be able to cope with clock-setup and tzsetup udebs.
  * Display an error if we can't fetch the Kickstart file from HTTP/FTP, or
    if we can't mount the given NFS server.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon,  8 Aug 2005 15:04:13 +0100

kickseed (0.28) breezy; urgency=low

  * Make 'lang' preseed debian-installer/locale as well as preseed/locale,
    in order to work with localechooser >= 0.07.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 19 Jul 2005 17:23:27 +0100

kickseed (0.27) breezy; urgency=low

  * Use 'mount -o nolock' when retrieving Kickstart files over NFS, which is
    massively faster since we aren't running the usual userspace support.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 20 Jun 2005 19:05:02 +0100

kickseed (0.26) breezy; urgency=low

  * Implement device --opts, now that hw-detect supports it.
  * Implement bootloader --password and --md5pass options.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon,  6 Jun 2005 12:17:24 +0100

kickseed (0.25) breezy; urgency=low

  * Send stderr from %pre scripts to /var/log/messages.
  * Don't send %post stdout to /var/log/messages, and don't truncate that
    file!

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri,  6 May 2005 20:39:09 +0100

kickseed (0.24) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add native support for custom d-i preseeding. The syntax is 'preseed
    [--owner PACKAGE] KEY TYPE VALUE'. The owner package defaults to "d-i".

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  5 May 2005 16:42:34 +0100

kickseed (0.23) breezy; urgency=low

  * Execute %pre sections without redirecting stdin, so that it's possible
    to use debconf from them.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  4 May 2005 17:17:41 +0100

kickseed (0.22) breezy; urgency=low

  * Make sure %pre and %post scripts are executable, so that debconf can
    re-exec them.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  4 May 2005 10:35:08 +0100

kickseed (0.21) breezy; urgency=low

  * Make 'url' preseed second-stage mirror configuration too.
  * Replace $OPTARG with $2 everywhere; fixes 'clearpart --drives'.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 15 Apr 2005 15:05:51 +0100

kickseed (0.20) breezy; urgency=low

  * Send warnings during installation to syslog, not stderr.
  * Fix handler arguments in the case where no arguments were passed to a
    command.
  * Fix langsupport to conform to Kickstart documentation and Anaconda.
    - If no non-option arguments were passed to langsupport, support all
      locales, per the Kickstart documentation. Yes, this will be slow. In
      that case, default to en_US.UTF-8 if there's no default set either,
      per Anaconda.
    - Otherwise, default to the first locale selected if there's no default
      set, per Anaconda.
  * Tolerate %pre and %post scripts exiting non-zero (log a warning rather
    than exiting).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 14 Apr 2005 12:46:55 +0100

kickseed (0.19) hoary; urgency=low

  * Very basic package group support, mapping package groups to tasks. Any
    package group name not containing a space causes the task of the same
    name to be installed; as special cases, "Ubuntu Desktop" and "Kubuntu
    Desktop" install the ubuntu-desktop and kubuntu-desktop tasks
    respectively; any other package group name triggers a warning.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sat, 26 Mar 2005 13:50:52 +0000

kickseed (0.18) hoary; urgency=low

  * Preseed netcfg/wireless_essid_again for noninteractive network setup,
    required by netcfg 1.08ubuntu3.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 23 Mar 2005 14:57:47 +0000

kickseed (0.17) hoary; urgency=low

  * Make setup/net only set questions if they aren't already flagged seen,
    to allow booting with something like 'ks=http://<server>/<path>
    netcfg/choose_interface=eth1'.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 22 Mar 2005 00:03:26 +0000

kickseed (0.16) hoary; urgency=low

  * Copy chrooted %post scripts to /target before executing them.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 21 Mar 2005 17:55:18 +0000

kickseed (0.15) hoary; urgency=low

  * Make 'xconfig --resolution' preseed xserver-xorg/config/display/modes
    rather than xserver-xorg/config/monitor/mode-list.
  * Add NIS authentication support.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 21 Mar 2005 16:19:55 +0000

kickseed (0.14) hoary; urgency=low

  * Preseed all console-keymaps-*/keymap questions, not just at.
  * Just warn on unrecognised commands, rather than dying.
  * Separate localechooser/supported-locales elements by ", ", not just " ".

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 17 Mar 2005 18:47:49 +0000

kickseed (0.13) hoary; urgency=medium

  * Ignore empty return from kickseed_cmdline, to avoid trying to bring up
    the CD and the network early when booting without the ks= argument.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  2 Mar 2005 20:37:22 +0000

kickseed (0.12) hoary; urgency=low

  * Fix kbd-chooser/method preseeding.
  * Use -o intr for NFS mounts.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  2 Mar 2005 20:09:53 +0000

kickseed (0.11) hoary; urgency=low

  * Run depmod before modprobe in /lib/kickseed/setup/hd.
  * Add support for ks=nfs:<server>:/<path>. Requires busybox-cvs
    20040623-1ubuntu13 and nfs-modules udebs.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue,  1 Mar 2005 13:45:07 +0000

kickseed (0.10) hoary; urgency=low

  * Add support for ks=ftp://<server>/<path>.
  * Implement user --disabled (Ubuntu extension), to disable creating the
    initial user.
  * Implement rootpw --disabled (Ubuntu extension), to explicitly disable
    the root password.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 28 Feb 2005 13:18:03 +0000

kickseed (0.9) hoary; urgency=low

  * Avoid unwanted expansion of $ in e.g. crypted passwords.
  * Implement user command; I've suggested it to Brent and Tammy Fox at Red
    Hat, but it's Ubuntu-specific for now.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 27 Feb 2005 22:59:43 +0000

kickseed (0.8) hoary; urgency=low

  * Make partman automatically partition without confirmation when
    partitions have been defined.
  * Fix timezone preseeding syntax.
  * Attempt to handle case where no growing partitions have been defined
    more gracefully. Changes to partman-auto will be required to do this
    properly, I think.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 27 Feb 2005 21:55:43 +0000

kickseed (0.7) hoary; urgency=low

  * Extra preseed for new Ubuntu keymap selector.
  * Implement ksdevice= to set the network interface used by netcfg.
  * Add support for ks=hd:<device>:/<file> to read a Kickstart file from a
    vfat or ext2 partition on an arbitrary device (although actually some
    other filesystems will probably work too). Requires anna 1.06ubuntu5.
  * Split out /proc/cmdline handling into /lib/kickseed/cmdline.sh.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 27 Feb 2005 11:26:18 +0000

kickseed (0.6) hoary; urgency=low

  * Merge file-kickseed and network-kickseed into initrd-kickseed. If
    reading a Kickstart file from CD-ROM or the network, install (using
    anna) and configure (using udpkg) the appropriate udebs first in order
    to make sure that the requested file is accessible.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 25 Feb 2005 20:16:21 +0000

kickseed (0.5) hoary; urgency=low

  * Add a network-kickseed package to allow downloading Kickstart files from
    the network (only HTTP so far).
  * Make packages that use /usr/share/debconf/confmodule depend on
    cdebconf-udeb.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 24 Feb 2005 10:24:54 +0000

kickseed (0.4) hoary; urgency=low

  * Make zerombr a no-op rather than dying.
  * Fix clearpart --initlabel.
  * "Implement" firewall --disabled/--disable.
  * Implement cdrom (a no-op, assuming that everyone using this will be
    booting with the cdrom initrd).
  * Implement clearpart --all, assuming for now that this means just the
    first disk; getting partman-auto to deal with multiple disks appears to
    be difficult. I'm not sure if this will work properly with e.g. USB
    installs.
  * Add a file-kickseed package to allow loading Kickstart files from CD-ROM
    or floppy disk.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  9 Feb 2005 13:54:00 +0000

kickseed (0.3) hoary; urgency=low

  * Implement langsupport.
  * Implement skipx properly (by not starting the display manager).
  * Implement rootpw --iscrypted.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue,  8 Feb 2005 14:54:06 +0000

kickseed (0.2) hoary; urgency=low

  * Add Standards-Version: field.
  * Force debconf priority to critical.
  * Implement 'timezone', having fixed base-config to make timezone
    preseeding easier.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon,  7 Feb 2005 16:52:56 +0000

kickseed (0.1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Initial release. This is still very experimental, doesn't implement all
    of Kickstart, is probably unable to do a completely automated
    installation yet, and can only read Kickstart files from the initrd.
    Nevertheless, it works as far as it goes.
