# We only support specific retrievers here, because some of them are
# difficult to use properly at this stage, and not all of them make sense.
# For instance, the netboot initrd already has enough packages to retrieve
# Kickstart files from the network, and if you were using that initrd it's
# unlikely that you'd want to retrieve Kickstart files from a CD.
#
# Whatever way we do it, this is going to be a hideous layering violation.
# The only question is which layers we violate. We call postinsts manually
# to avoid leaving packages configured, which would confuse d-i later on.
