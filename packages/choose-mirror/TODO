* If ftp or http isn't turned on, we can trim down the templates file..
  Or, if cdebconf supports registration, I could just collapse the more or
  less duplicate ftp and http templates into one, and register multiple
  questions from it. Which is probably best..
* Grab country names translations at build time by using the iso_3166
  translations from the iso-codes package. See countrychooser mechanism
  for this. Will save useless work to translators.
* Dynamically build list of suites on a mirror and let the user choose
  between them, instead of choosing from a static list that might be wrong.
  (The question is, where to get translated descriptions of the available
  suites? Or would a list of suite names w/o descrptions be ok as the
  question only shows up in expert mode?)
