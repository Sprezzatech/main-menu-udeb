preseed (1.05) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Strip off DOS line endings in preseed files.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * If preseed/url/checksum, preseed/file/checksum, or
    preseed/include/checksum exist, then the checksums are used to verify
    the preseed files, which can add some security/robustness to preseeding.
    (Note that checksums are not supported for preseed/include_command
    output.)

preseed (1.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Colin Watson
    - Add preseed/interactive question, allowing you to preseed default
      answers to questions but still have them asked. Needs di-utils 1.09.
  * Joey Hess
    - Move debconf-set-selections to preseed-common, remove dep on di-utils.
      Only preseed seems to use it, so might as well concentrate preseeding
      stuff here.
    - Add a new env-preseed udeb, gather the bits from rootskel and
      di-utils that were used for (boot-time) environment overriding of
      debconf values (env2debconf and the init script that runs it), and
      move them into this new udeb.
    - Log variables preseeded from the environment in the preseed log file,
      but leave them commented out, since environment preseeding is typically
      used for one-off overridding, and we don't want preseeded
      debconf/priority or the like to affect the installed system. Probably.
