* Several of the functions in main_menu return 1 for success, 0 for
  failure. They should be changed to return as system() or an enum, so
  menu items that return 10 to signal backup work. Since it's kinda hard to
  fix these (I tried and failed), we currently have the nasty global
  last_item_backup.
