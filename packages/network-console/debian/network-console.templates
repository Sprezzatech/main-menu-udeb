_Description: Remote installation password:
 You need to set a password for remote access to the Debian installer. A
 malicious or unqualified user with access to the installer can have
 disastrous results, so you should take care to choose a password that
 is not easy to guess. It should not be a word found in the dictionary,
 or a word that could be easily associated with you, like your middle
 name.
 .
 This password is used only by the Debian installer, and will be
 discarded once you reboot into your newly-installed system.
