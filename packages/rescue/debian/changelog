rescue (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Fabio M. Di Nitto ]
  * Fix rescue/$item/intro to get to the right template.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Make README more consistent with reality (recommend type text for intro
    template, not note).
  * Go back to the rescue operation menu if the user backs up from an intro
    question.
  * Bump to 1.0 as rescue is fairly stable now.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * rescue.d/reboot: Safe to use 'umount -a' again.

rescue (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use debconf-disconnect from di-utils 1.18.
  * After selecting the root filesystem, display a menu with the things you
    can do to the root filesystem rather than just dropping you into a
    shell. This also provides a mechanism for other udebs to provide custom
    rescue operations.
  * Stop suppressing udeb retrieval with anna/standard_modules, since other
    udebs may now be useful.
  * Remove Standards-Version:, not applicable to udebs.
