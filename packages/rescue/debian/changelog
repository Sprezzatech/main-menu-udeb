rescue (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use debconf-disconnect from di-utils 1.18.
  * After selecting the root filesystem, display a menu with the things you
    can do to the root filesystem rather than just dropping you into a
    shell. This also provides a mechanism for other udebs to provide custom
    rescue operations.
  * Stop suppressing udeb retrieval with anna/standard_modules, since other
    udebs may now be useful.
  * Remove Standards-Version:, not applicable to udebs.
