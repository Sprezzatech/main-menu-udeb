* autodetection of ide devices would be nice, rather than always loading
  the ide modules

* perhaps probe to see if the module can actually be loaded before bugging the
  user for any more information?

* probe the card to see if the modules is already loaded

* clean up the return values, decide what is really a failure, and how to handle it

* should we try to detect ISA devices?
