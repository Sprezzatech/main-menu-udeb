debootstrap (0.4.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Anthony Towns ]
  * Make debootstrap team maintained under the d-i banner.
  * Add Joey, Frans and Junichi as uploaders, remove JHM (not in the
    d-i group).
  * Make pkgdetails.c not need C99 extensions. (Closes: Bug#398977)
  * Fix am_doing_phase implementation in debootstrap script. Thanks to
    Tero Janka for spotting the problem and the fix. (Closes: Bug#409881)

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Drop support for sarge from the udeb.
  * Update README.Debian:
    - One todo item is done. (I think cross-strap is too, but unsure.)
    - Reword NMU policy to note that it's team-maintained now.
  * ACK my prior NMU. Closes: #418600
  * If /dev/MAKEDEV DNE, as on certain s390 machines, use /sbin/MAKEDEV.
    Closes: #420908
    Note that /dev/MAKEDEV is still the correct location, and is still tried
    first so that building works on all FHS systems, as noted in #190239.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add support for Ubuntu dapper (Closes: #342838), edgy, feisty, and
    gutsy. Exclude everything but gutsy from the udeb.
  * Fix "deboostrap" typo in debootstrap(8) (thanks, Adam Conrad).
  * Fix "htp" typo in temporary /etc/apt/sources.list.
  * Drop support for woody from the udeb too.
  * When removing $TARGET/debootstrap, debootstrap.log is still open as
    stdout/stderr and needs to remain so, but after unlinking it some NFS
    servers implement this by a temporary file in the same directory, which
    makes it impossible to rmdir that directory. Moving it instead works
    around the problem (thanks, Steven McCoy;
    https://launchpad.net/bugs/65003).
  * Fix formatting error in debootstrap(8) (.R is not a macro).
  * Reorganise scripts into scripts/debian/ and scripts/ubuntu/ directories
    in the source tree to declutter the top level.
  * Add default_mirror function; reorganise the debootstrap script a little
    so that it works. Set the default mirror for Ubuntu suites to
    http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu, and the default mirror for Debian
    etch/lenny/sid architectures other than amd64 and i386 to
    http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian (per ajt; see bug #363049).
  * Add devices created by fd to devices-std.tar.gz, so that
    /dev/std{in,out,err} is available conveniently in chroots with /proc and
    /dev/pts mounted (thanks, Matthias Klose).
  * Document --keyring and --make-tarball. (Closes: #368988)
  * Update Ubuntu mirrors: warty/hoary/breezy => old-releases.ubuntu.com,
    unsupported architectures => ports.ubuntu.com.

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove the entended package description (aka bloat) from the udeb.

  [ Steve Kemp ]
  * Avoid errors compiling pkgdetails.c (Closes: #398977)

debootstrap (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sid script updated:
    - Determine base dynamically (Priority: required for required packages,
      Priority: important for base packages, Build-Essential: yes for buildd
      variant base). (Closes: Bug#88984, Bug#193134)
    - Use fine grained dpkg progress display, thanks again to Colin Watson.
      (Closes: Bug#229314, Bug#231109, Bug#244563)

  * dpkg output (etc) goes to /var/log/bootstrap.log in the target, rather
    than stdout. This is probably difficult for frontends to capture
    at present.

  * Parsing of Packages file sped up. (Yay!)

  * debootstrap.deb now arch: all (Closes: Bug#122465, Bug#131552)
    - perl implementation of pkgdetails used by preference
    - devices.tar.gz reduced to minimal set of devices; frontends should
      setup udev or supply their own devices or similar in future
    - /usr/lib/debootstrap/arch not shipped
    - none of the above applies to udebs yet; though the devices.tar.gz
      change will eventually

  * Support for verifying based on Release.gpg files (--keyring). Thanks
    to Colin Watson. (Closes: Bug#313383)

    + Initial support for fine-grained dpkg progress display, thanks to
      Colin Watson (currently only for warty and hoary)
    + Initial support for determining base system dynamically.
    + No longer display "debootstrap.invalid" when working with
      Release/Packages files. (Closes: Bug#241795, Bug#256255)
    + Ignores failures for on_exit cleanup commands. (Closes: Bug#253387,
      Bug#253468, Bug#308774)
    + Early reporting of unavailable packages.
    + More efficient parsing of Packages files.
    + Generalised additions and exclusions. (Closes: Bug#191793)
    + Handles symlinked configuration files in /etc a little better.
      (Closes: Bug#161987, Bug#252907, Bug#272257)

  * Dropped support for slink.

  * Use ln -fs for mawk/awk link. (Closes: Bug#248398, Bug#258524)

debootstrap (0.1.17.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * The "it didn't change the way the installer worked" release.
  * Makefile: create $(DESTDIR)/usr/share/man/man8 before attempting to
    install a file to it (Closes: #139543)
  * functions: fix race condition in smallyes() implementation; thanks to Matt
    Zimmerman for the analysis.  "Sometimes, dpkg finishes executing before
    smallyes runs, and it loops forever while echo fails repeatedly due to the
    broken pipe."  To fix this race, we simply swap the loop condition and
    body, so that if the echo fails, smallyes() exits cleanly.  I further
    changed "true" to ":" to save the expense of an extra process for shells
    where "true" is not a built-in.

  * Don't use PIPESTATUS to work out if wget succeeded, since that's a
    bashism and we're seriously not allowed bashisms. Duh. This should
    help with all those "Malformed release" problems. Thanks to Phil
    Blundell and Chris Tillman for spotting this. (Closes: Bug#136729)

  * Apply patch from Matt Zimmerman to get rid of some irritating warnings
    that can show up sometimes due to sed getting it's output stream closed
    on it. (Closes: Bug#131478)

  * Don't use "export foo=bar" on a single line since it's a bashism.
    (Closes: Bug#138187)

  * Made the "smallyes" usage independent of --boot-floppies. Too much
    code duplication otherwise.

  * Install ipchains on arches that have 2.2.x kernels by default, and
    iptables on arches that have 2.4.x kernels by default. Some arches
    have both. (Closes: Bug#134478)

  * Don't rm malformed Release files, rename them to something obvious
    instead so people can have a hope at seeing what's going on. (Closes:
    Bug#131756)

  * Error out on missing entries in Release files. (Closes: Bug#136886)

  * Fix basedeb creation to not bother building devices tarball. (Closes:
    Bug#137243)

  * Workaround for ldconfig no longer needed, so removed. (Closes: Bug#135819)
  * Workaround for /dev/initctl was never needed and stupid, so removed.

  * Make sure devices.tar.gz is gzip -9'ed. (Closes: Bug#136687)

  * Use any "main" components found in Release file, eg "main",
    "non-US/main", "local/main". (Closes: Bug#116801)

  * Add parted to base for ia64. (Closes: Bug#138246)

  * Moved the "successful!" message and sleep hack for boot-floppies from
    the woody script to the debootstrap script itself.

    needed for modern device drivers (Joysticks, USB, Scanners)
  * added pppoeconf to the packages list, better choice for DSL users

  * Informative error for people who type `--boot-floppies' when running

  * Create dev/initctl in target, and setup a cat process to dump anything

    it doesn't try doing anything too clever to talk to the real
    init. (Closes: Bug#120597)
  * Create awk symlink since base-files insists on having it available.

  * non-maintainer upload
  * Fix progress bar hooks to enable proper progress on basedebs.tgz
    installation as well as actual base installation and extraction.
  * trap signals so cleanup is still performed.
  * When in --boot-floppies mode echo a Success info message to stdout, so
    it will show up on /dev/tty4, this is so users watching tty4 stop
    being confused when things just stop at completion.
  * Replace $TARGET/sbin/start-stop-daemon with a shell script instead of
    /bin/true, this shell script announces that its a fake noop version so
    users will know whats wrong if debootstrap aborts before completion.

 -- Ethan Benson <erbenson@alaska.net>  Sat,  3 Nov 2001 23:14:08 -0900

debootstrap (0.1.15.7) unstable; urgency=high

  * non-maintainer upload
  * when reporting errors in 'in_target', don't chop down to the first
    50 characters
  * woody: when in boot-floppies mode, provide more user-friendly warning
    messages, using new 'in_target_msg' function
  * woody: more info messages for the core/required/base package
    installation part
  * instead of 'ln -s' we should be using 'ln -sf'; this would prevent
    running debootstrap twice in the same target dir; closes: #111065
  * before mounting proc, umount it just in case; normally this shouldn't
    be needed if on_exit is working all the time, but I find without this,
    sometimes problems are caused

debootstrap (0.1.15.5) unstable; urgency=high

  * From Ethan Benson:
  * pipe yes output into dpkg runs inside install_debs() this way on_exit
    works in --boot-floppies mode. (Closes: #112842, #115481)
  * Add libpcap0 to base, ppp depends on it now. (Closes: #114056)

  * From Adam Di Carlo:
  * Potato installation on non-i386 was broken, need libc6
    (closes: #112778); however, there are other ways the Potato base
    install doesn't represent quite what Potato boot-floppies would
    consider base
  * apply patch from Tommi Virtanen which improves the 'smallyes'
    function; apparently this fixes a console-tools postinst loop,
    although I haven't seen that (closes: #115581)
  * get rid of some line continuators in potato and woody scripts, they

debootstrap (0.1.15.3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix deficient command line option parsing, optional arguments no

  * Add --help option and useful help output.
  * Stop using dirname, basename, and yes, they are being removed from
    busybox.
  * Fix many many quoting bugs.
  * Fix debootstrap man page (Closes: #107404, #109670)
  * Add ftp support (Closes: #110312)
  * Don't waste time downloading useless non-free/contrib (Closes: #89673)
  * Path cleanup (Closes: #97174)
  * Add pppconfig to woody base (Closes: #111001)
  * Remove syslinux from base (Closes: #107447)
  * Eliminate useless warning about creating exim.conf (Closes: #99229)
  * Don't use "here documents" (they create tmp files in /tmp which could
    be very well be full on boot-floppies).
  * Don't use echo -n it is not portable.
  * Set umask to 022.
  * All patches from Ethan Benson, I am just the builder!
    These have been tested with boot-floppies and work properly.

  * Don't use seq. Silly busybox.
  * Add pppoe to base. (Closes: Bug#102378)

debootstrap (0.1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make in_target_nofail kill stderr. No more "/dev/pts: not mounted" error.
    Yay. :)

  * Refactor woody, potato and slink scripts; do away with
    woody.debs. Change the way the scripts work. (Now they define
    functions which debootstrap calls. Much nicer)
  * Support --download-only option.
  * Support resuming downloads of Release and Packages files, even gzipped
    ones.
  * Support null: (Packages files assumed to be named for a debootstrap.invalid
    host)
  * Always use the deboostrap.invalid name, and use that in
    /etc/apt/sources.list. Remove /etc/apt/sources.list after the base
    system is build.
  * All this should be enough to support basedeb.tgz installs on
    debootstrap's behalf. Some more stuff would be useful, but isn't
    immediately necessary. (Closes: Bug#102217)

  * Add ia64 support and fix libc6 == libc6.1 problem. (Closes: Bug#101829)

  * Be a little more careful with permissions on devs tarball. Hopefully.
    (Closes: Bug#102308)

  * Don't worry if md5sum from stdin adds a "  -" after the md5sum. Should
    make debootstrap more usable on non-Debian Linuxes.

    be recent enough. (Closes: Bug#97713)
  * Check for malformed release files. Thanks to Martin Michlmayr for the
    patch. (Closes: Bug#97707)
  * Use --force-confold when installing base. That is: if you want the
    conffile from the package to be there at the end, don't create a
    file in the first place. I'm not convinced this is right.

    by Richard Hirst.
  * Added console-tools and console-data into the base system.
  * Move /etc/exim.conf to /etc/exim/exim.conf so that sendmail doesn't
    give errors, even if debconf tries to use it before exim is
    configured.  Gack.
  * Add fdutils back into base.

    (Closes: Bug#94575)
  * Use s///I instead of s///i for case insensitivity, again for busybox.
    (Closes: Bug#94579)
  * Fixed typo that would have stopped debootstrap from falling back to an
    uncompressed Packages file.
  * Added libsasl7 and libldap2 to woody base, since woody exim now depends
    on them.

debootstrap (0.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * If we've got a Release file, check that the Packages files we download
    have the right md5sums.
  * Build-Depend on new makedev, and don't hax0r powerpc devices as much.
    (Closes: Bug#93836)
  * Hopefully support arm chroots. (Closes: Bug#92592) Declare it to be
    Arch: any, and see what dies. There's a chance that nothing will. Not
    a *big* chance, but a chance.
  * Fiddled with the base system some more. Added apt-utils so
    preconfiguration will work.
  * Added permission to NMU to the README.Debian.
  * Mention file:/ URLs in README.Debian. (Closes: Bug#87099)
  * Add a --boot-floppies option that changes the way the I/O happens, in
    a way that's hopefully useful for boot-floppies. See README.Debian for
    details.
  * Also added a bit more output.

debootstrap (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Switch from debconf-tiny to debconf, since that's what's now in
    woody. (Using debconf-tiny probably makes the package unusable, hence
    the urgency) Fixup perl, lilo and console-apt to cope with changes in
    the base system in woody. Added ae, left nano and nvi.
  * Add support for m68k, sparc and powerpc, based on Christian Steigies
    patches and Adam Di Carlo's NMU (Closes: Bug#89883, Bug#91221)

debootstrap (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for slink.
  * Fix support for woody (no lilo, console-*, different perl)
  * Re-download Packages files every time (Closes: Bug#88438)
    (Should this be changed to re-download things where the md5 doesn't match?)

debootstrap (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release. (Closes: Bug#82245)

  * Called it debootstrap instead of debchroot, because it's more about
    bootstrapping a Debian environment, whether that will end up being
    in a chroot, or as a standalone system. Blame Adam di Carlo. :)
