- try to simplify the maze of little shell fragements that call each other
  w/o documentation
- move as much as possible of the non-root-skeleton stuff out to other
  packages. This package was rather more comprehensible when it was a few
  empty directories and some simple files in /etc. 

  Of course the debian-installer-startup and other similar directories
  won't be improved by being moved, and seem to fit as well here as
  anywhere else.

  However, parts of it, like the framebuffer startup code, are not needed
  by all images, and could usefully by moved to a separate udeb elsewhere.
- Move rootskel-locale off to some other udeb (possibly one just including
  the locale built by whatever package builds it?)
- Move all the debconf templates to elsewhere.
