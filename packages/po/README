This is the directory for ALL translation files for Debian Installer
packages.

By putting a xx.po (or xx_YY.po) file here, based on template.pot you will
find also in this directory, the translation it contains will be spread
out to ALL Debian Installer packages under packages/

DO NOT do this before reading the documentation in installer/doc/i18n/i18n.txt
and PLEASE CONTACT the Debian Installer i18n coordination team before
doing so.

More specifically, DO NOT switch your translations to this new "single
file" method without first warning the i18n coordination of D-I. The
switch needs special care and should be handled by the coordinators.

The PO files headers will be spread out to all D-I packages. If you want
to give credit to several translators, please use the header comment lines
rather than the "Last-Translator" line. In such case, the Last-Translator
line should rather contain the team name, similarly to the
Translation-Team line.
