This is the directory for ALL translation files for Debian Installer
packages.

By putting a xx.po (or xx_YY.po) file here, based on template.pot you will
find also in this directory, the translation it contains will be spread
out to ALL Debian Installer packages under packages/

DO NOT do this before reading the documentation in installer/doc/i18n/i18n.txt
and PLEASE CONTACT the Debian Installer i18n coordination team before
doing so.

More specifically, DO NOT switch your translations to this new "single
file" method without first warning the i18n coordination of D-I. The
switch needs special care and should be handled by the coordinators.

The PO files headers will be spread out to all D-I packages. If you want
to give credit to several translators, please use the header comment lines
rather than the "Last-Translator" line. In such case, the Last-Translator
line should rather contain the team name, similarly to the
Translation-Team line.

Synchronisation script:
-----------------------

The synchronisation script is run at regular intervals by one the the i18n
coordinators. Please see the i18n documentation in installer/doc/i18n for
details.

 Current schedule:
 -----------------

- daily run at 00:27 UTC on the trunk branch
- weekly run at 21:27 UTC on Sundays for the sarge branch

 Triggering immediate runs:
 --------------------------

Official DDs can trigger runs of the l10n-sync script by issuing the
following on alioth.debian.org:

touch ~bubulle/d-i/l10n/.run-sync

 Stopping the automated runs:
 ----------------------------

Automated runs can be stopped (in case the script becomes crazy) by
using "run=0" in packages/po/run-l10n-sync

 Enforcing the script runs:
 --------------------------

In case the script is disabled by "run=0", it can be manually run by
using the "--force" switch. Use with care: this should be reserved to
cases where the i18n coordinator is away and his script became
crazy. In that case, another d-i developer can still run l10n-sync
from time to time, manually.
