This udeb modifies the Squeeze installer to support Lenny installations.

The udeb will be installed automatically by either cdrom-detect,
iso-scan or choose-mirror if Lenny is selected for installation.

FEATURES
========
- Disables support for ext4 in partman as neither the Lenny kernel nor
  Lenny userland applications support it. Could possibly be re-enabled
  if there's a lenny-and-a-half which adds kernel and userspace support
  for ext4.
- Avoid displaying Lenny's console-setup dialogs during base-installer.
