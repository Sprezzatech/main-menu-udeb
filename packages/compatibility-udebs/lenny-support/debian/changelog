lenny-support (0.01) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * First release.
  * Disable support for ext4; could possibly be re-enabled if there's a
    lenny-and-a-half which adds kernel and userspace support for ext4.
  * Edit kbd-chooser post-base-installer.d script to avoid display of
    Lenny's console-setup dialogs.
