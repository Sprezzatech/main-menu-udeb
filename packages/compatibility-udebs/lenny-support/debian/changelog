lenny-support (0.01) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * First release.
  * Disable support for ext4; could possibly be re-enabled if there's a
    lenny-and-a-half which adds kernel and userspace support for ext4.
  * Edit kbd-chooser post-base-installer.d script to avoid display of
    Lenny's console-setup dialogs and copy correct debconf settings.
  * Make grub the default again instead of grub-pc and disable installation
    of os-prober on the target system as the Lenny version is unsafe.
  * Disable installation of Recommends by default for the duration of the
    installation, unless a specific setting was preseeded.
  * Select a 'lennynhalf' kernel if one is available.
