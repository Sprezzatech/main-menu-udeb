* fix bugs
 1) Multiple packages are removed from status file. e.g.
  udpkg -r apt-move_4.1.13_i386.deb removes both apt and apt-move from the status file

 2) udpkg -i apt-move doesnt add all the fields to the status file that dpkg does.

 3) Improve error handling, when the disk is full at 'ar' and 'tar' fails.

* Check to see which of the above are really bugs. This TODO file is quite
  old..

* Integrate any useful changes from the branches/packages/udpkg/devel
  branch.
