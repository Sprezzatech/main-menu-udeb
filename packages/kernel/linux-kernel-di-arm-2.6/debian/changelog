linux-kernel-di-arm-2.6 (0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Martin Michlmayr ]
  * Create initial 2.6 packages for ARM.
  * Update copyright information.
  * Remove riscpc, riscstation and lart (at least for now) since there's no
    support in d-i for them.
  * Rename netwinder to footbridge and bast to s3c2410 to comform with
    the upstream names.
  * Add support for NSLU2 (Network Storage Link for USB 2.0 Disk Drives).
