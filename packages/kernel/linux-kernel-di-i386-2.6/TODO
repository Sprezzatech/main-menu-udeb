* The 2.6 kernel is missing a lot of modules, need to get a list of all
  modules included in the udebs, and compare vs. the full module list and
  add missing stuff.

* Dependent modules are not getting pulled in. For example, vga16fb needs
  cfbcopyarea and it is not included in fb-modules. Maybe the .ko hack
  doesn't work?
