* The lists should be sorted, so if we need to trim space we can remove
  from the end.
* Better docs for making a custom modules package, or using a different or
  custom kernel.
* Support Depends_subarch in package-lists, not currently supported in
  gen-deps or gen-control.
* Add some form of kernel version specifier to the modules files, so we
  can differentiate between 2.4 and 2.6 kernel modules better and turn on
  some modules in some packages only for 2.6 or 2.4. Such as sym53c8xx_2
  and sym53c8xx.
