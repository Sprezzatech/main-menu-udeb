build-arch

This is a wrapper script to build a specific architecture.

It takes the architecture to be built as parameter and that architecture
needs to be listed in kernel-versions.  
It expects to have the unpacked kernel packages for the architecture in
e.g. ../alpha. modules.dep files have to be put in there too if they are
not shipped in the .deb (varies)

dpkg-cross must be installed, but you do not need a cross compiler.
