* Find out which ISA ethernet cards discover(2) can probe safely, and add
  them to nic-shared-modules or their own package. There is still 100+k free
  on the net_drivers floppy.
* Move wireless drivers from nic-extra-modules back to nic-modules;
  we have space for them now. Note that this changes deps of
  pcmcia-modules.
