Package: nic-sbus-modules
Priority: standard
Description: SBus network card modules for Sparc32/65 kernels
 This package contains the drivers for the Happy Meal/Big Mac 10/100BaseT,
 Sun QuadEthernet and MyriCOM Gigabit Ethernet SBus devices for SPARC
 systems. Do not install this package on a real Debian system! You probably
 want a kernel-image package instead.

Package: nic-pci-modules
Priority: standard
Description: PCI network card modules for Sparc64 kernels
 This package contains various device drivers for PCI network cards. PCI is 
 only supported with the 64-bit Ultra architecture so there's no corresponding
 sparc32 version.
