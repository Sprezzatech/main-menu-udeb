This udeb will prepare the target system to run base-config after the reboot.
It also installs network-console-config if the installation is taking place
over ssh and sets up base-config to be run when the installer user logs into
the system after reboot.

This is only needed when installing Sarge using the Etch installer.

TODO
====
- something needs to be made responsible for installing this udeb...
- base-installer needs to be fixed so it will fall back to initrd-tools
  of neither yaird or initramfs-tools available
- base-installer selects smp kernel by default for 2.6.8 kernel (vmware, 686)
- for some arches kernel selection may be completely broken for Sarge
  installations due to 2.4->2.6 switch
- Sarge does not like the 'hotplug' networking setup
- Sarge's base-config does not like to be in UTF-8 environment
- clock setup (UTC/local), timezone iselection and apt-setup are run
  unconditionally, so these should be disabled in 1st stage
- base-config somehow sets up apt for testing instead of stable
