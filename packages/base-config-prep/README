This udeb will prepare the target system for Sarge installations using the
Etch installer. It reintruduces some functionality that was dropped for Etch
but is needed when installing Sarge.
Note that the aim is not to perfectly reproduce a Sarge install, just to get
things working.

FEATURES
========
- if network-console is not used, inittab is set up to start base-config
  on reboot
- if network-console is used, the 'installer' user is set up in the target
  system; base-config is run on (remote) login using this user
- disable 'hotplug' networking configuration for eth0 as otherwise it will
  probably not be brought up on boot
- create /var/log/debian-installer symlink to /var/log/installer

DIFFERENCES
===========
There are some notable differences with a real Sarge install.
Note: this list is i386 centric.
- udev will be installed by default when using 2.6 based install
- environment will be set up to use UTF-8 by default

TODO
====
- something needs to be made responsible for installing this udeb...
- base-installer needs to be fixed so it will fall back to initrd-tools
  if neither yaird or initramfs-tools are available (maybe with a kernel
  version check)
- base-installer selects smp kernel by default for 2.6.8 kernel (vmware, 686)
- for some arches kernel selection may be completely broken for Sarge
  installations due to 2.4->2.6 switch; maybe even explicitly not support these
- Sarge's base-config does not like to be in UTF-8 environment (English install)
  - unicode-start has been run for base-config, but borders are missing
  - for other VTs, unicode-start has not been run
  - for VT1 the problems are gone after reboot, not for the others
  - for base-config, this is a termwrap problem: disabling jbfterm in termwrap
    (like is already done for Greek) solves the problem
- clock setup (UTC/local), timezone iselection and apt-setup are run
  unconditionally, so these should be disabled in 1st stage
- functionality for network-config installs is untested
