mountmedia (0.17) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * The script has not used the right name for the debconf template
    since 2005! That's conclusive proof that we don't need the debconf
    template, at all, so remove it.
  * No longer asks a question, which Closes: #352474
  * Renamed the package, to reflect that it doesn't just do floppies.
  * "mountmedia driver" can be used to ensure that a driver floppy,
    containing udebs (or debs) is loaded.
  * When looking for drivers, also try to mount removable USB storage, not
    just floppies. Whole hard disks and also partitions will be scanned as
    well.
  * "mountmedia floppy" can be used to force the old behavior, of only
    trying to load floppies.
