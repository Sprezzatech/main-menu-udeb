_Description: Device for boot loader installation:
 Aboot needs to install the boot loader on a bootable device containing
 an ext2 partition.  Please select the ext2 partition that you wish
 aboot to use.  If this is not the root filesystem, your kernel image
 and the configuration file /etc/aboot.conf will be copied to that
 partition.

_Description: No ext2 partitions found
 No ext2 file systems were found on your computer.  To load the Linux
 kernel from the SRM console, aboot needs an ext2 partition on a disk
 that has been partitioned with BSD disklabels.  You will need to
 configure at least one ext2 partition on your system before continuing.
