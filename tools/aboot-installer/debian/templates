_Description: Device for boot loader installation:
 Aboot needs to install the boot loader on a bootable device containing
 an ext2 partition.  Please select the ext2 partition that you wish
 aboot to use.  If this is not the root filesystem, your kernel image
 and the configuration file /etc/aboot.conf will be copied to that
 partition.
