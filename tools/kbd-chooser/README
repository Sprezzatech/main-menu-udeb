This is not yet integrated into the debian-installer build.
To test:

- Add 'kbd-chooser', 'console-keymaps-ps2' and  'console-keymaps-usb' to debian-installer/build/pkg-lists/base
- run 'debuild -uc -us' in this directory
- copy ../kbd-chooser*.udeb to debian-installer/build/localudebs


--------------------------


Compile in support for various keyboards.

Note: its possible to have a variety of 'non-arch' keyboards, eg. it is possible to put a 
Sun keyboard on a PC, using a serial adaptor. This is why all keymaps are present in
'console-data'. However this is unlikely (and I don't think you can boot off a serial keyboard),
so they are likely not to be compiled in on floppy versions (though maybe CD versions) of
the installer.
