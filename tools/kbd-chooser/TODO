- Add regression test to ensure data udebs are correct
	(For space, no error checking done in this code)

- Add code to handle serial & ssh installs (not installing kbd where
  not needed)

- Finish template & i18n code

- Trim loadkeys() code.


- Later in the install process, when /target is mounted, we should dump
  a default keymap into place in /etc/console.
