usb-discover (0.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Remove unnecessary hard-coded path to modprobe.
    - Add PCI id (11660220) of the USB controller in a IBM
      Bladecenter. Closes: #220230
      (Bug also filed against discover-data, but for now this change is
      not in that package.)

usb-discover (0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved the code to a program in PATH, named usb-discover, and make the S45
    script just run that program. This is to support the linuxrc.bootfloppy,
    which does not run init scripts and needs to be able to call usb-discover
    manually.

usb-discover (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sebastian Ley
    - S45usb-linux: Do not die if something goes wrong (in this case, no pci
      detected) because the file is sourced. This was responsible for the
      endless loop when testing d-i with bochs. Thanks Steinar H. Gunderson.
      (Closes: #210818)
  * Alastair McKinstry
    - Move to Standards-Versiob 3.6.1.0; no changes required.
    - Move Build-Depends to Build-Depends-Indep; no arch-dependent pkgs.
