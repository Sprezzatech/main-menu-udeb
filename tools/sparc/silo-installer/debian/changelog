silo-installer (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Add a dependency on di-utils-mapdevfs.
  * Joshua Kwan
    - Merge the completely different silo-installer 0.0.1 that is in
      unstable. The one that is actually being used at the moment :(
    - Add success message for when DEBCONF_PRIORITY is medium.
    - If /boot is mounted separately, do not tell silo to use /boot/vmlinuz
      but to use /vmlinuz (because it is all relative to /boot.)
  * Translators: do not modify this changelog to record changes you make to
    po files. A record of your contributions will be added to the changelog
    at package release time by the output-l10n-changes program.
