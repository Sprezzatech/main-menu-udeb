Template: cdrom-detect/manual_config
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Manually select a CD-ROM module and device?
 No common CD-ROM drive was detected. 
 .
 Your CD-ROM drive may be an old Mitsumi or another non-IDE, non-SCSI
 CD-ROM drive. In that case you should choose which module to load and
 the device to use. If you don't know which module and device are
 needed, look for some documentation or try a network installation
 instead of a CD-ROM installation.

Template: cdrom-detect/is_cd_inserted
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Perform manual CD-ROM configuration?
 Your installation CD-ROM couldn't be mounted. 
 .
 This probably means that the CD-ROM has not yet been inserted. If
 that is the case, just insert it and don't perform the manual
 configuration. The CD-ROM mount will be re-tried.
 .
 If your CD-ROM is already in the drive, there was another problem. You
 should try the manual CD-ROM configuration.

Template: cdrom-detect/cdrom_module
Type: select
Choices: ${choices}
Default: none
_Description: Module needed for accessing the CD-ROM:
 The automatic detection didn't find a CD-ROM drive. You can try to
 load a specific module if you have a unusual CD-ROM drive (that is
 neither IDE nor SCSI).

Template: cdrom-detect/cdrom_device
Type: string
Default: /dev/cdrom
_Description: Device file for accessing the CD-ROM:
 In order to access your CD-ROM drive, please enter the device file that
 should be used. Non-standard CD-ROM drives use non-standard device
 files (such as /dev/mcdx).
 .
 You may switch to the shell on the second terminal (ALT+F2) to check the
 available devices in /dev with "ls /dev". You can return to this screen
 by pressing ALT+F1.

Template: cdrom-detect/success
Type: note
_Description: CD-ROM detected
 The CD-ROM autodetection was successful. A CD-ROM drive has been found and it
 currently contains the CD ${cdname}. The installation will now continue.

Template: cdrom-detect/no-cd
Type: error
_Description: No CD detected
 Please check that a CD has been inserted into the CD-ROM drive.

Template: cdrom-detect/wrong-cd
Type: error
_Description: Non-Debian CD-ROM detected
 The CD-ROM drive contains a non-Debian CD.
 .
 Please insert a Debian CD to continue with the installation.

Template: cdrom-detect/skip_autodetection
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Skip CD-ROM automatic detection?
 If the CD-ROM automatic detection causes trouble, you may skip this
 step.  However, you will need to manually mount the CD-ROM on /cdrom
 before you can proceed.

Template: mirror/distribution
Type: select
_Choices: stable, testing, unstable
Default: testing
_Description: Debian version to install:
 Debian comes in several flavors. Stable is well-tested and rarely changes.
 Unstable is untested and frequently changing. Testing is a middle ground,
 that receives many of the new versions from unstable if they are not too
 buggy.
