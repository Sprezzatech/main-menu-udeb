Template: cdrom-detect/not_included
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Do you want to load the missing module from a drivers floppy ?
 The module required for ${vendor} (${module}) is missing from this
 installation disk. If you want to load it from a driver floppy, then
 insert this floppy disk in the floppy drive and choose yes. Otherwise
 choose no.

Template: cdrom-detect/manual_config
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Do you want to manually select the CDROM module and device ?
 Apparently, we couldn't detect any common CDROM reader. But you may
 have an old Mitsumi or another non-IDE, non-SCSI CDROM reader. In
 that case you can indicate which module to load and which devide to
 use. If you know what module we have to use, answer yes, otherwise
 look for some documentation or try a net install instead of a CDROM
 install.

Template: cdrom-detect/is_cd_inserted
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Is the installation CD in the CDROM reader ?
 We couldn't mount your installation CD. That probably means that the CD
 is not yet inserted. If that's the case, please insert it and answer no.
 Otherwise answer yes and you'll be prompted for a manual configuration.

Template: cdrom-detect/cdrom_module
Type: select
Choices: ${choices}
Default: ${default} 
Description: Select a module to load for the CDROM support
 Apprently the autodetection didn't find any CDROM reader. You can try to
 load one of the modules if you have a specific CDROM reader
 (that is neither IDE nor SCSI).

Template: cdrom-detect/cdrom_device
Type: string
Default: ${default} 
Description: Give the corresponding device file
 In order to get access to your CDROM reader, I must know which device
 file should be used since non-standard CDROM reader use non-standard
 device files like /dev/mcdx for example.
 .
 You may switch to the shell on the second terminal (ALT+F2) to
 check the available devices in /dev with "ls /dev". You can come
 back here with ALT+F1.

Template: cdrom-detect/success
Type: note
Description: A CDROM has been detected.
 The autodetection worked. A CDROM reader has been found.
 It contains the following CD : ${cdname}
 You can continue the install.

Template: cdrom-detect/skip_autodetection
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Do you want to skip CDROM autodetection ?
 You may want to try that if autodetection is causing troubles. Otherwise
 you really shouldn't as it won't let you go any further without
 manual intervention to mount the CDROM on /cdrom.
