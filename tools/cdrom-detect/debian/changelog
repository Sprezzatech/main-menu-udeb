cdrom-detect (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix up using discover somewhat
  * Remove emacs changelog variables
  * Make _all udeb, not _$(ARCH)
  * Strip off the Package header in the templates file, since it could
    confuse cdebconf.
  * Get rid of the build-dep on cdebconf-dev, we don't build-dep on it at
    all.
  * Use discover's database instead of detect, build-dep accordingly.
  * Add Brazilian Portuguese and Danish debconf templates.
  * Make debian-boot maintainer with hertzog and tfheen in uploaders.
