cdrom-detect (0.03) unstable; urgency=low

  * exit 0 if the cd is already mounted.
  * Set debconf answer mirror/distribution using info from the
    detected CD.
  * Convert to po-debconf, set Build-Depends-Indep: debhelper (>= 4.1.13)
    to ensure that generated templates are right, and set output encoding
    to UTF-8.
  * Drop depend on non-existant package discover-basic-udeb.
  * Correct floppy device, and try to load the floppy driver module
    before mounting floppies.
  * Make sure driver modules fetched from floppy are owned by root, to
    avoid rejections from depmod -a.

cdrom-detect (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix up using discover somewhat
  * Remove emacs changelog variables
  * Make _all udeb, not _$(ARCH)
  * Strip off the Package header in the templates file, since it could
    confuse cdebconf.
  * Get rid of the build-dep on cdebconf-dev, we don't build-dep on it at
    all.
  * Use discover's database instead of detect, build-dep accordingly.
  * Add Brazilian Portuguese and Danish debconf templates.
  * Make debian-boot maintainer with hertzog and tfheen in uploaders.
