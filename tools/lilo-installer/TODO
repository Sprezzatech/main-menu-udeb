* User friendlier question for boot device, e.g. a select question that
  also includes an 'other' choice for people living wildly. I suppose the
  only reasonable choices are the MBRs and the partition that /target/boot
  is on.

* If booting from a partition, make it bootable... Something like this:
    echo ',,,*' | sfdisk /dev/discs/$DISC/disc -N$PARTNO
  ?
