autopartkit
===========

  A tool to automatically partition hard disks.  It is mostly useful as
  part of a bootstrap package.  It is currently used in
  debian-installer.

Table format
------------

  The format are lines with four fields:
    <mount-point> <filesystem> <minsize> <maxsize>'
  The fields are split on whitespace.

  Normal partitions

    /mount/point  fs-type                             min-size-mb  max-size-mb

  Swap partitions

    <unused>      swap                                min-size-mb  max-size-mb

  Dummy partitions (pass on to /etc/fstab).  This is useful for tmpfs
  entries.

    /mount/point  <passed-on>                         0            <unused>

  LVM partitions and volumes

    vg-name       lvm                                 min-size-mb  max-size-mb
    /mount/point  lvm:vg-name:lv-volume-name:fs-type  min-size-mb  max-size-mb
