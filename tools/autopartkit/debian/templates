Template: autopartkit/confirm
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Are you sure you want to automatically partition the disk ?
 The disk you selected is going to be modified. The partitionner may resize
 windows FAT partitions and will create new partitions for Debian
 GNU/Linux. If you have important data that are not backuped, you may
 want to answer no to let you do a backup. You'll have to restart the
 installation later.
 .
 Otherwise answer yes to continue the installation process.

Template: autopartkit/error
Type: note
Description: An error occured during the previous operation.
 You may be able to continue. Here's some more informations :

 ${error}

Template: autopartkit/refuse
Type: note
Description: The partitionner will not work.
 The actual version of the autopartitionner is not elaborated enough to
 handle the partitionning of the selected disk. It will partition only
 either empty disk or disks with no more than 2 FAT partitions (and no
 extended partitions or other non-FAT partitions).
 .
 If you want to continue the installation process, switch to the second
 console (ALT+F2), partition the disk as you like using parted and the
 other tools available, and then mount all your partitions in /target.
 /target is the root directory of your new system, so your root
 parition will be mounted on /target and your /usr partition
 must be mounted on /target/usr.
 .
 You can also consider launching this program again but selecting another
 disk.

Template: autopartkit/notenoughspace
Type: note
Description: The disk doesn't have enough space.
 The autopartitionner makes some asumptions about partition sizes,
 and because of that it requires at least 3Gb of free space. It appears
 that you don't have that much space.
 .
 If you really want to install, you'll have to make some free space
 before, or you may relaunch this program and select another disk with
 more free space.

Template: autopartkit/debug
Type: note
Description: Debug information about ${variable}
 Here's some debug information. The value of ${variable} is :

 ${value}

Template: autopartkit/success
Type: note
Description: The partitionning has been successfully completed.
 The required partitions have been created and mounted on /target.
 You can now continue the installation process.
