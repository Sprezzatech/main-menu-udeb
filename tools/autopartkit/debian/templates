Type: select
Choices: ${CHOICES}
_Description: Select the device to partition (the install device)
 Choose the disk which has the free space required (column Free) to install
 Debian GNU/Linux. If there's not enough free space, space can be
 liberated by resizing the FAT partitions (column FreeFat indicates how much
 space will be freed by resizing the existing fat partitions).

Template: autopartkit/confirm
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Are you sure you want to automatically partition the disk ?
 This will destroy the partition table on all disks in the machine.
 REPEAT: THIS WILL WIPE CLEAN ALL HARD DISKS IN THE MACHINE!
 If you have important data that are not backed up, you may want to
 stop now in order to do a backup. In that case, you'll have to
 restart the installation later.

Template: autopartkit/error
Type: note
_Description: An error occured during the previous operation.
 You may be able to continue. Here is some more information :

 ${error}

Template: autopartkit/refuse
Type: note
_Description: The partitioner will not work.
 This version of the autopartitioner is not elaborate enough to handle the
 partitioning of the selected disk. It will partition only an empty disk or
 a disk with no more than 2 FAT partitions (and no extended partitions or
 other non-FAT partitions).
 .
 If you want to continue the installation process, switch to the second
 console (ALT+F2), partition the disk as you like using parted and the
 other tools available, and then mount all your partitions in /target.
 /target is the root directory of your new system, so your root partition
 will be mounted on /target and your /usr partition must be mounted on
 /target/usr.
 .
 You can also consider launching this program again but selecting another
 disk.

Template: autopartkit/notenoughspace
Type: note
_Description: The disk doesn't have enough space.
 The autopartitioner makes some assumptions about partition sizes, and
 because of that it requires at least 3Gb of free space. It appears that
 you don't have that much space.
 .
 If you really want to install, you'll have to make some free space
 available, or you may relaunch this program and select another disk with
 more free space.

Template: autopartkit/debug

Template: autopartkit/success
Type: note
_Description: The partitioning has been successfully completed.
 The required partitions have been created and mounted on /target. You can
 now continue the installation process.

Template: autopartkit/partition_table
Type: text
Default: /etc/autopartkit/default.table
_Description: File containing the requested partition table
 The automatic partitioning will be created using the partitions and
 sizes specified in this file.
