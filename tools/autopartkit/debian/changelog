autopartkit (0.35) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Remove depends on di-fake and profilechooser, since those aren't in
    Debian.
  * André Luís Lopes :
    - Sync pt_BR template translation with the latest english.
  * Use 'GPT' as default disk label type on ia64.
  * Rename debconf_* functions to mydebconf_*, to avoid conflict with
    upcoming cdebconf.
  * Print config.log if configure fails.  This will help me debug the
    build problem on the mipsel buildd.

autopartkit (0.34) unstable; urgency=low

  * Get the package working with libparted 1.6.
  * Change default filesystem from ext3 to ext2.  I was wrong
    thinking ext3 was supported in libparted 1.6.
  * Add forgotten postinst script.
  * Make it easier to select default disk label type at run time.
  * Use 'msdos' disk label type on platforms where the proper type is
    unknown.  This avoids a compile error on these platforms.
  * Log default disk label type.
  * Code cleanup to avoid some compile warnings.
  * Reinsert versioned depend on po-debconf.  This will make sure the
    templates use UTF-8.
  * Add more specific depend for virtual package libcdebconf-dev.
  * Remove yes/no from autopartkit/confirm template, correct spelling.
  * Make sure PED_DONE() is called on successfull termination.

autopartkit (0.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * Development version moved from Skolelinux into Debian CVS.  Skipping
    version numbers 0.2 - 0.32 used by Skolelinux versions.
  * Moved partition requests into separate .table files, and choose table
    based on debian-installer/profile content.  Add depend on
    profilechooser to make sure debconf contain the requested multiselect
    value.  If the value is empty or unknown, use default.table.
  * Split partitioning operation in two, one calculating the new partition
    layout, and another doing the change.  This will make it possible to
    preview the partitioning changes.
  * Add depend on di-fake to make sure libparted.so is available at run
    time.
  * Change orders of provides entries to get around a bug in anna.  This
    should get base-installer to depend on autopartkit.
  * Increase priority to standard to get anna to install this package by
    default.
  * Refuse to compile on platforms where the default partition table
    format is unknown.  At the moment this is all non-x86 platforms.
  * Add code to handle both v1.4 and v1.6 of libparted.  The code uses
    v1.6 API, but there is a compatibility wrapper in parted-compat.h
  * Source converted to use autoconf/automake.
  * Change log location to /var/log/messages.
  * Change menu entry and confirm question to make it more obvious that
    this is an unsafe program.
  * Make sure we ask the user if it is OK to destroy the partition tables
    before destroying the partition tables.
  * Add code to handle several different file system types.
  * Add SCSI-support.
  * Add some support for creating LVM partitions.
  * Change menu item value from 3 to 50 to match new numbering schema.
    The package both partitions and mounts, this its range is 40-60.
  * Make this package compile with both libparted 1.4 and 1.6.
  * Use libparted 1.6 by default.
  * Use 'ext3' by default when using libparted 1.6.

autopartkit (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * Never released.  Some of the changes might have been lost in 0.33.
  * Change build-deps to libcdebconf-dev.
  * Remove emacs changelog variables.
  * Don't try to do funky stuff with ../cdebconf/src, build-dep on
    libcdebconf and be done with it.

  * Changed build-deps to libparted1.6-dev
  * Add Brazilian Portuguese debconf template.

    to UTF-8.
  * André Luís Lopes
    - Sync pt_BR translation with original english.
    - Unfuzzy lots of old translations.
