autopartkit (0.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * Development version moved from Skolelinux into Debian CVS.  Skipping
    version numbers 0.2 - 0.32 used by Skolelinux versions.
  * Moved partition requests into separate .table files, and choose table
    based on debian-installer/profile content.  Add depend on
    profilechooser to make sure debconf contain the requested multiselect
    value.  If the value is empty or unknown, use default.table.
  * Split partitioning operation in two, one calculating the new partition
    layout, and another doing the change.  This will make it possible to
    preview the partitioning changes.
  * Add depend on di-fake to make sure libparted.so is available at run
    time.
  * Change orders of provides entries to get around a bug in anna.  This
    should get base-installer to depend on autopartkit.
  * Increase priority to standard to get anna to install this package by
    default.
  * Refuse to compile on platforms where the default partition table
    format is unknown.  At the moment this is all non-x86 platforms.
  * Add code to handle both v1.4 and v1.6 of libparted.  The code uses
    v1.6 API, but there is a compatibility wrapper in parted-compat.h
  * Source converted to use autoconf/automake.
  * Change log location to /var/log/messages.
  * Change menu entry and confirm question to make it more obvious that
    this is an unsafe program.
  * Make sure we ask the user if it is OK to destroy the partition tables
    before destroying the partition tables.
  * Add code to handle several different file system types.
  * Add SCSI-support.
  * Add some support for creating LVM partitions.
  * Change menu item value from 3 to 50 to match new numbering schema.
    The package both partitions and mounts, this its range is 40-60.
  * Make this package compile with both libparted 1.4 and 1.6.
  * Use libparted 1.6 by default.
  * Use 'ext3' by default when using libparted 1.6.
