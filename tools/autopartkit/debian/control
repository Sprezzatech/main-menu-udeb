Description: Automatically Partition Hard Drives (safe)
 This module will automatically partition the harddrive on which you wish
 to install Debian GNU/Linux. It will keep any existing partition and use
 the free space available. If there is no space it will try to resize
 FAT partition (but it'll leave around 25% free space in each FAT
 partition).
 .
 At the present time is uses only libparted and is therefore limited to
 architecture supported by libparted (i386 only?).
 .
 autopartkit is a minimal package used by debian-installer.
