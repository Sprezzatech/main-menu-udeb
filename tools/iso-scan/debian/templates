_Description: Do full disk search for installer ISO?
 The quick scan for installer ISOs, which looks only in common places,
 searched ${NUM_DIRS} directories in ${NUM_FILESYSTEMS} file systems without
 finding an installer ISO. It's possible that a more thorough search will
 find the ISO, but it may take a long time.

Template: iso-scan/no-isos
Type: error
_Description: Failed to find an installer ISO
 No installer ISOs were found. If you downloaded the ISO, it may have a
 bad filename (not ending in ".iso"), or it may be on a filesystem that
 could not be mounted. You'll have to do a network install instead, or
 reboot and fix the ISO.

_Description: Failed to find an installer ISO
 Of ${ISO_COUNT} possible ISO images found, ${ISO_MOUNT_FAILURES} could
 not be mounted, and an installer ISO was not found. Perhaps the ISO you
 downloaded is corrupt? You'll have to do a network install instead, or
 reboot and fix the ISO.

_Description: Found no installer ISOs
 ${ISO_COUNT} ISO image(s) were found, but none were valid installer ISOs.
 You'll have to do a network install instead, or reboot and fix the ISO.
