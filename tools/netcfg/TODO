* put in checks so the user can't enter data that is clearly invalid (perhaps this will be done through debconf.
* do other sorts of network configurations (pcmcia, ppp)
* pppconfig would be a good starting point for the ppp udeb.  There is also an example in there of how to use pppd to detect a modem.

* netcfg-dhcp : when we use dhclient if we don't obtain a lease, dhclient goes
 into the background and the installer thinks that it succeeded.  This isn't
 right.
