* menutest : check for existance and size, of conf files (any other checks?)
* search for network interfaces and allow the user to choose which one they want to configure
* put in checks so the user can't enter data that is clearly invalid
* dhcp: either another module, or in here
* fall back to safe defaults if the user doesn't enter a particular value (ex. gateway)
* create config dirs if they don't exist
* use the the debconf library rather than our own debconf.[ch]
* do other sorts of network configurations (pcmcia)
