* try to do dhcp first without asking for a specific DHCP hostname, just ask for
  the hostname that will be written to /etc/hosts.  If DHCP fails then have a
  dialog indicating that some cable modem providers require you to specify a 
  special DHCP hostname.  You can enter that here now if you want.
  

* Nameserver and domain are in the common configuration?  Should they be? 

* we should send a dhcp hostname

* put in checks so the user can't enter data that is clearly invalid (perhaps
  this will be done through debconf.

* do other sorts of network configurations (pcmcia, ppp)

* pppconfig would be a good starting point for the ppp udeb.  There is also an
  example in there of how to use pppd to detect a modem.


* Make netcfg-static smarter about default values, e.g. call ifconfig and
  parse.
