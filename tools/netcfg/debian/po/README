1.  Initialization
    --------------

    The po/ directory is not used to build templates files, but instead
    is a show-room for po-debconf.  In order not to conflict with current
    templates files, the procedure to generate files is somewhat special,
    these commands were run from the debian/ directory:
    
      mkdir po
      for t in common dhcp static
      do
          debconf-gettextize -F --new-templates=po/netcfg-$t._templates \
                    template/netcfg-$t.templates
      done
    
    IMPORTANT NOTE:  template/*.templates.en must first be renamed into
                     template/*.templates
    
    NOTE: For a casual package, one only has to run
             debconf-gettextize foo.templates
    
2.  Update
    ------

    When _templates files are modified, PO files are updated by running
    	debconf2po-update
    from the debian/ directory.

3.  Merge
    -----

    The following commands can be run to merge translations, in the
    top-level directory:

       for TYPE in common dhcp static
       do
           po2debconf --podir=debian/po debian/po/netcfg-$TYPE._templates \
               > debian/netcfg-$TYPE.templates
       done
       for TYPE in dhcp static
       do
           echo >> debian/netcfg-$TYPE.templates
           cat debian/netcfg-common.templates >> debian/netcfg-$TYPE.templates
       done

    NOTE:  For a casual package, _templates files are located under
           debian/ and not debian/po/, so --podir flag is then useless.

4.  Warning
    -------

    This is experimental, please do not modify these files or your
    changes may be lost.
