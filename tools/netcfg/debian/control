Description: Configure the network via DHCP
 Many networks allow automatic configuration via DHCP (Dynamic Host
 Configuration Protocol).  If you are on a corporate network, a cable modem,
 some DSL connections, or have any other sort of dynamic IP for Ethernet, you
 will likely be able to configure via DHCP. If you have information such as IP
 address, netmask, gateway, then DHCP is not appropriate.
