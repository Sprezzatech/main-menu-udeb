grub-installer (0.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Brazilian Portuguese, Catalan and Danish debconf templates.

  * Avoid crashing when trying to call db_subst with an empty value.
  * Convert to po-debconf, set Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 4.1.13)
    to ensure that generated templates are right, and set output encoding
    to UTF-8.
