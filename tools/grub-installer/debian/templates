_Description: On which device should GRUB be installed?
 GRUB needs to install the stage 1 boot loader on a bootable device. This
 is usually the first hard drive. Note that GRUB counts devices differently
 than the Linux kernel, so the first one is usually '(hd0)'. Leave this at
 default if unsure.
