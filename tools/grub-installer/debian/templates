Type: string
Default: (hd0)
_Description: Device for boot loader installation:
 GRUB needs to install the stage 1 boot loader on a bootable device. This
 is usually the first hard drive. Note that GRUB counts devices differently
 than the Linux kernel, so the first one is usually '(hd0)'. Leave this at
 default if unsure.

Template: grub-installer/apt-install-failed
Type: boolean
Default: yes
_Description: GRUB installation failed.  Continue anyway?
 The grub package failed to install into /target/.  Installing GRUB
 as a boot loader is a required step.  The install problem might however be
 unrelated to GRUB, so continuing the installation may be possible.
