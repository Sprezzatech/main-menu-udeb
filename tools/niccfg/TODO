* can we dynamically figure out what nic modules are available? modprobe -l -t
 net gives us ppp modules too.  We could parse
 /var/lib/dpkg/info/nic-modules-blah*.list, but the package name is volatile.  
 * figure out how we are going to load their random module, put in some checks to be sure it exists before trying.
