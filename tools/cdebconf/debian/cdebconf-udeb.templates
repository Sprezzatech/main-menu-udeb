Template: debconf/priority
Type: select
Choices: critical, high, medium, low
Default: critical
Description: Ignore questions with a priority less than..
 Packages that use debconf for configuration prioritize the 
 questions they might ask you. Only questions with a certain 
 priority or higher are actually shown to you; all less 
 important questions are skipped.
 .
 You can select the lowest priority of question you want to see:
  - 'critical' is for items that will probably break the system
     without user intervention.
  - 'high' is for items that don't have reasonable defaults.
  - 'medium' is for normal items that have reasonable defaults.
  - 'low' is for trivial items that have defaults that will work in
    the vast majority of cases.
 .
 For example, this question is of medium priority, and if your
 priority were already 'high' or 'critical', you wouldn't see this
 question.
