      Closes: #218869.
    - Look for translated Listorder fields so that translators may decide
      not to sort Choices fields, e.g.
        Listorder-ja.UTF-8: none

    - Add myself, Petter, and Randolph to Uploaders.

cdebconf (0.48) unstable; urgency=low

  * Denis Barbier
    - Sort translated choices when a select/multiselect template contains
      a line Listorder: lexicographic
      If some Choices items must not be sorted, they can be prepended with
      an exclamation mark.  Adding a comment is a good idea to let
      translators know why this sign has been put here:
        _Choices: ${FOO}, !Other[ You only have to translate Other, remove the exclamation mark and this comment between brackets]
      Currently text, newt, slang and gtk frontends support this feature.
    - Fix a crash with the newt frontend when a boolean question has no
      default value. Closes: #215583.
    - Let cdebconf newt frontend looks like debconf dialog: short description
      is moved just before input field, except for note and error template
      types.  Closes: #215582.
    - Make strlongest aware of wide chars.
    - Windows now adjust to text size with the newt frontend,
  * Steinar H. Gunderson
    - Makes cdebconf assume "show only unseen questions" by default,
      which makes it behave a lot more like debconf. This also makes
      unattended installs (ie. installs with pre-seeded debconf databases)
      possible without a non-interactive frontend.
    - Updated dpkg-reconfigure to make cdebconf show unseen questions,
      to keep it updated with the change above.
  * Kęstutis Biliūnas
    - Add Lithuanian translation (lt.po).
  * Claus Hindsgaul

      cdebconf-gtk-udeb.templates and cdebconf-slang-udeb.templates
    - Add a 'templates' target in src/modules/frontend/Makefile to

    - Add internationalization of the buttons in the newt frontend.
    - Hide the Go Back button instead of disabling it if backup is
      disabled. A proper fix for colour sets would be better, but
      this is less confusing for now.
    - Set the background color to red when displaying an error message.

      in a normal installation, as uain-menu will adjust the debconf
      priority dynamically.
    - Add new command SETTITLE to make it possible to use translated
      titles. (Closes: #212923)

cdebconf (0.42) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sebastian Ley
    - Add code to be able to change frontends on the fly. It is done by

      you want to change to. This value is checked before each GO command.
  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Update ru.po, patch from Serge Winitzki.
  * Steinar H. Gunderson
    - Make question_get_field always return a valid string, even when it
      gets a NULL pointer from the templates (which happens when a frontend
      tries to look up a non-existing field). (Closes: #211315)

      (Closes: #203334)

  * Bastian Blank
    - fix macros in debconfclient.h.
  * Sebastian Ley
    - Memory cleanup. Dropped some const qualifiers which are obsolete due to
      Martins cleanup of const buffers.

  * Thorsten Sauter
    - fix German translation

    - libdebconf.so is put in /usr/lib/cdebconf and found via rpath info.
    - Make me the current uploader of this package.
    - frontends/newt: When splitting up description and choices in two
      windows, make sure the user can back up to the description.
      (Closes: #188710)
    - Redesign the command functions to get rid of the space mangling.
      (Closes: #185014)
    - Add DEBCONF_OLD_{STDIN,STDOUT}_FD that point to the original stdin
      and stdout, to be used by console programs like starting a shell.
    - frontends/newt: Fix crash bug on double invocation of PROGRESS STOP.
    - frontends/newt: Change OK/Cancel to Continue/Go Back, and lay some
      ground work for i18n.
    - Redesign the progress API, see the docs. (Closes: #188243)
    - When asked the same question twice, ignore one of the questions to
      prevent looping. This is what perl-debconf does too.
    - Add a 'priority' member to the question struct that can be used by
      frontends.
    - frontend/newt: Show a "sigil" in the title that indicates the
      priority of the question. (Closes: #184816)

    - Remove code to reconfigure the language when SIGUSR1 is recieved.
      This is now done when 'SET debconf/language' is used instead.
      SIGUSR1 still saves the database to disk.

cdebconf (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Correct section of libdebconf1-dev from devel to libdevel to
      make sure it matches the override file in the debian archive.
    - Update /usr/share/debconf/confmodule to match the version in
      debconf 1.2.34.  This might solve the problem on disappearing
      whitespace.  The only difference left is the progress support.
    - Try to change the language imediately when debconf/language is
      set.
    - Add asserts() in question_get_field() trying to find out why
      cdebconf crashes.
    - Double the buffer used when loading templates.  This is a
      workaround for bug #188043, but the code should be rewritten
      to remove the limit.
  * Martin Sjögren
    - templates.c: Fix segfault bug in the getlanguage for loop.

      (Closes: #182357,#186413)
  * Sebastian Ley
    - The CAPB command now sets exactly the capabilities that were given as
      arguments. This makes it possible to turn of backup.
  * Denis Barbier
    - src/debconfclient.c: remove dependencies against common.h and
      strutl.h so that debconfclient.[ch] can be moved to a separate
      libdebconfclient package.
  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Reduce the priority from critical to medium when setting the
      current debconf priority.

      are not reformatted were gobbled
    - finish support for backing up; names of seen questions are
      stored in a new member of confmodule, these questions are
      only marked as seen when session is over.
    - when SIGUSR1 is received, reads debian-installer/language value
      and sets LANGUAGE environment variable accordingly.
    - change progress bars interface: displayed strings are extracted
      from a template in order to help their l10n.
    - with text frontend, do not display title when question is
      skipped.  (closes: #177720)
  * Tollef Fog Heen:

    - check for value == NULL within command_get and command_metaget.
    - use default language for metaget.
    - add STRDUP_NOTNULL with the old behaviour of STRDUP. the client 
      doesn't expect a value of NULL.
    - add myself to Uploaders.
  * Denis Barbier:
    - Clean up function interface with l10n'ed fields: 'get' and 'set'
      functions in the template structure are no more used.
    - The getlanguage function is moved to template.c so that i18n is
      fully handled by template.c
    - Remove a superfluous trailing space in extended descriptions
    - Use LANGUAGE environment variable instead of DEBCONF_LANG.
      This variable is a colon separated list of languages.
    - Fix the textdb driver wrt localized fields

      question_get_field(q,l,"value") always return a valid string.  With the
      latter, variable substitutions are also performed.
    - Add support for the DEBCONF_SHOWOLD environment variable.  Its default
      is currently "true".
    - Improve support of the 'seen' flag; dixit joeyh, flags should be
      set when closing session to help backing up, but it needs some
      extra work.

cdebconf (0.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tollef Fog Heen:
    - Add stack module.
    - Add possibility to specify modname when doing template_db_new and
      question_db_new, this breaks compatibility, so bump soname as well.
      Integer sonames are good for your health and stomach, so make
      libdebconf.so.1 the soname
    - have make clean remove the static library as well.
    - make -o in debconf work.
    - fix harmless compile warning in rfc822db.c's get method.
  * Denis Barbier:
    - Fix select/multiselect with slang frontend
    - remove defaultval member in question structure
    - partially handle localized fields, only UTF-8 templates files
      are considered
    - change internal template structure in src/template.h in order
      to help managing localized fields, and fix doc/modules.txt
      accordingly
    - define accessors to get and set template values, should be used
      everywhere instead of direct access to structure members
    - modify question API when dealing with templates values
    - fix frontends and db to work with these changes

      a dot to end.
