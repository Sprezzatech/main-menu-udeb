cdebconf (0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * Randolph Chung
    - added support for progress bars; bump the minor so version
    - add a printf style api for debconfclient; add helper macros
      for debconf commands (not yet completely verified)
    - add debconf-communicate utility program
    - fix text frontend so it never thinks the screen width is 0
  * Denis Barbier:
    - in databases encode strings as debconf does
    - when reading templates files, newlines at the end of lines which
      are not reformatted were gobbled
    - finish support for backing up; names of seen questions are
      stored in a new member of confmodule, these questions are
      only marked as seen when session is over.
    - when SIGUSR1 is received, reads debian-installer/language value
      and sets LANGUAGE environment variable accordingly.
    - change progress bars interface: displayed strings are extracted
      from a template in order to help their l10n.
    - with text frontend, do not display title when question is
      skipped.  (closes: #177720)
  * Tollef Fog Heen:
    - Move rfc822 functions into libcdebconf from rfc822db module
    - Fix getwidth to work properly on serial consoles.  Hopefully.
  * Martin Sjögren:
    - Make the slang frontend slightly friendlier to programs that produce
      output themselves.
  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Add configure option --with-default-frontend to make it easier to
      change frontend at compile time.
    - In cdebconf-udeb, do not change the debconf priority setting if
      environment DEBCONF_PRIORITY is set.
    - The slang frontend is no longer part of cdebconf-udeb, but is
      a separate package (Closes: #84230).
  * Matt Kraai
    - Add a cdebconf-slang-udeb package.
    - NULL-terminate strvacat argument lists (Closes: #178402).

cdebconf (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * Denis Barbier:
    - improve slang frontend, in order to make it more dialog-like.
      When it is not ambiguous, pressing Enter key validate current
      input and go to the next step.  Rename <Previous>/<Next> into
      <Next>/<Cancel>.
    - add support for backing up; it is only activated when script
      invoke the "backup" debconf command.
  * Tollef Fog Heen
    - remove textdb from udeb build

cdebconf (0.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bastian Blank:
    - split cleanup() into save() and cleanup().
    - add a sighandler for SIGUSR1 which only saves the data.
  * Denis Barbier:
    - when a select has a single choice, let it be the default.
    - cdebconf did gobble everything in extended descriptions
      after a paragraph or a line beginning with a leading space.

cdebconf (0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bastian Blank:
    - fix multiselect question within the text frontend.
    - add sighandler for SIGTERM
    - add exit(1) to the end of the sighandler.
    - modify the macros STRDUP and FREE to handle null pointers correctly.
    - use question_getvalue(...) not q->value.
    - check for value == NULL within command_get and command_metaget.
    - use default language for metaget.
    - add STRDUP_NOTNULL with the old behaviour of STRDUP. the client 
      doesn't expect a value of NULL.
    - add myself to Uploaders.
  * Denis Barbier:
    - Clean up function interface with l10n'ed fields: 'get' and 'set'
      functions in the template structure are no more used.
    - The getlanguage function is moved to template.c so that i18n is
      fully handled by template.c
    - Remove a superfluous trailing space in extended descriptions
    - Use LANGUAGE environment variable instead of DEBCONF_LANG.
      This variable is a colon separated list of languages.
    - Fix the textdb driver wrt localized fields
    - Support localized Default fields
    - There are now 2 ways to retrieve question values, question_getvalue(q,l)
      return either NULL or question value if it exists, and
      question_get_field(q,l,"value") always return a valid string.  With the
      latter, variable substitutions are also performed.
    - Add support for the DEBCONF_SHOWOLD environment variable.  Its default
      is currently "true".
    - Improve support of the 'seen' flag; dixit joeyh, flags should be
      set when closing session to help backing up, but it needs some
      extra work.

cdebconf (0.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tollef Fog Heen:
    - Add stack module.
    - Add possibility to specify modname when doing template_db_new and
      question_db_new, this breaks compatibility, so bump soname as well.
      Integer sonames are good for your health and stomach, so make
      libdebconf.so.1 the soname
    - have make clean remove the static library as well.
    - make -o in debconf work.
    - fix harmless compile warning in rfc822db.c's get method.
  * Denis Barbier:
    - Fix select/multiselect with slang frontend
    - remove defaultval member in question structure
    - partially handle localized fields, only UTF-8 templates files
      are considered
    - change internal template structure in src/template.h in order
      to help managing localized fields, and fix doc/modules.txt
      accordingly
    - define accessors to get and set template values, should be used
      everywhere instead of direct access to structure members
    - modify question API when dealing with templates values
    - fix frontends and db to work with these changes

      for broken questions, since it breaks if the question is

      a dot to end.
