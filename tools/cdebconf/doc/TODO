Short term:
* reduce namespace pollution of public functions/structures -- we need a prefix
* implement the "seen" flag correctly
* Finish implementing the rest of commands.c, and test
* handle backing up better - if we do high-low-high priority backing up can go
  into an infinite loop (debconf handles this)
* Perl interface module (DebConf::Client::ConfModule) for perl-based config
  scripts
* develop regression test suite -- automated testing would be nice, and 
  shouldn't be too difficult to do
* provides ways to build a smaller cdebconf without "optional" features (for
  debian-installer)
* i18nized messages; handle i18n-ied templates
* cleaner build environment
* authentication for database modules
* Frontends
  - ncurses (in progress)
  - slang (may be better?)
  - fbdev (in progress - drow)
  - noninteractive (think automated installs) - how to deal with the "seen"
    flag?
  - Xt/Xlib/gtk ?
* Databases
  - perldb (reads debconf's Data::Dumper database)
  - pgsql
  - mysql
  - openldap
  - xml
  - Oracle
* Better API documentation

Long term:
* transactions
* object locking
* triggers (see spec)
