Issues with the cdebconf progress bars
======================================

The cdebconf progress bars are currently driven by the following protocol:

PROGRESS START <min> <max> <title-template>
PROGRESS STEP <inc> <info-template>
PROGRESS STOP



This is wildly incompatible with what debootstrap uses, which is:

P: <curr> <max> <title-string>
I: <info-string>

In debootstrap there is no concept of starting and stopping, a progress
bar simply "is" and has a current and a max value. The info is decoupled
from the actual stepping.



Thus, I suggest we change the protocol to something that interacts more
easily with debootstrap, something like:

PROGRESS START <min> <max> <title-template>
PROGRESS SET <val>
PROGRESS INFO <info-template>
PROGRESS STOP

The quick&dirty way would be to just overlay this, since there are no
conflicts in naming, but that feels like a bad solution. I would rather rip
out the current code before it gets too widely used.
