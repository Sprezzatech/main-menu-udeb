disk-detect (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * NOT RELEASED.
  * Fix typo in postinst script.
  * Correct floppy device, and try to load the floppy driver module
    before mounting floppies.
  * Make sure driver modules fetched from floppy are owned by root, to
    avoid rejections from depmod -a.
  * Use the same way as discover to find out if a module is available.
  * Always load sd_mod if a scsi controller module was loaded
  * Include simple description of a driver floppy.  Some cleanup.
  * Make it easier to inspect the generated HW detection lists.
  * Convert to po-debconf, set Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 4.1.13)
    to ensure that generated templates are right, and set output encoding
    to UTF-8.
