disk-detect (0.02) unstable; urgency=low

  * NOT RELEASED.
  * Fix typo in postinst script.
  * Pass the output from discover through 'sort -u' to avoid trying to
    load the same module twice.
  * Correct floppy device, and try to load the floppy driver module
    before mounting floppies.
  * Make sure driver modules fetched from floppy are owned by root, to
    avoid rejections from depmod -a.
  * Use the same way as discover to find out if a module is available.
  * Always load sd_mod if a scsi controller module was loaded
