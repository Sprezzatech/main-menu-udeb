* support non-i386 archs, the boot floppies partitioner has some ifdef's for arm etc. that should be integrated
* menutest might be too simple, is that all we want?
* decide on an automatic partitioning scheme, perhaps find the total space on all available drives and divide it up somehow between  / , /usr, /var /home ?
