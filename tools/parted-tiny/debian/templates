Template: parted-tiny/no_hard_drives
Type: note
Description: No hard disks drives could be found.
 Make sure they are cabled correctly and are turned on before the system is
 started. You may have to change driver settings when you start the system with
 a command at the "boot:" prompt, or you may have to load a driver that is in a
 loadable module to solve this problem.

Template: parted-tiny/table_report
Type: note
Description: The following partitions have been detected:
 Device         Mounted on                 Type
 -------------  -------------------------  -------------------------
 ${partition_table}

Template: parted-tiny/make_swap
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Would you like to do without a swap partition? 
 A swap partition is a good idea for all systems, even ones with lots of
 memory.  It's strongly encouraged that you create one. If you have less than 8
 megabytes of RAM in your system, you will need to create a swap partition
 simply so that there is enough virtual memory to finish the installation. If
 you answer "Yes" to the following question, the system will not require you to
 create a swap partition. It's strongly advised that you answer "No".

Template: parted-tiny/pre_2_2_compat
Type: boolean
Default: yes
Description:  Do you want to retain Linux kernel 2.0 compatibility?
 This 2.2 version of the Linux kernel has new "ext2" filesystem features not
 present in earlier kernel versions. Using these features, however, means that
 you will not be able to use this filesystem with earlier kernels, such as
 Linux 2.0. 

Template: parted-tiny/skip_bad_block_scan
Type: boolean
Default: yes
Description: Should the bad-block scan be skipped on '${partition}'
 The system can scan the entire partition for un-readable disk blocks and will
 mark any such bad blocks it finds so that they will not be used. This requires
 that every block be read, and thus could take a long time, but may save you
 trouble later.  Modern disk controllers generally do not need this, since they
 can identify and deal with bad blocks automatically, so the default is not to
 perform this check.

Template: parted-tiny/choose_drive
Type: select
Choices: ${drives}
Description: Which drive would you like to partition?
 Select the drive to partition. SCSI drives are listed in disk ID number order.
 Only drives that were connected and operating when the system was started will
 show up in this display. CD-ROM drives may be mis-identified as writable disk
 drives by this menu.

Template: parted-tiny/choose_mount
Type: string
Description: Where would you like to mount ${partition}?
 You must choose the mount point for this partition.
