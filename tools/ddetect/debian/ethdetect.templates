Template: ethdetect/detection_type
Type: select
Choices: passive, none
Default:  passive
Description: What level of hardware detection would you like?
 I can automatically detect some hardware.  If you want me to try to detect
 your hardware you can choose between full and passive detection.  Full
 detection may involve probing which could cause the computer to hang.  Some
 hardware, like ISA cards, can only be detected with full detection.  If you
 don't want me to do any detection, choose 'none' and you will be prompted.

Template: ethdetect/module_select
Type: select
Choices: 3c509, ne, ne2000, 3c59x, acenic, dgrs, dmfe, eepro100, epic100, hp100, ibmtr, ne2k-pci, old_tulip, rtl8139, sis900, sktr, tlan, tulip, other
Default: unknown
Description: What module does your ethernet card require?
 This is a list of modules that I know about.  Choose the module from the list
 that supports your card.  If your card requires a different module, choose
 'other' and you will be prompted for the location of that module.  

Template: ethdetect/module_prompt
Type: string
Description: Where is the module for your ethernet card?
 Please enter the full path to the module for your ethernet card.

Template: ethdetect/module_params
Type: string
Description: Please enter any additional parameters.
 Some modules accept load-time parameters to customize their operation.  These
 parameters are often I/O port and IRQ numbers that vary from machine to
 machine and cannot be determined from the hardware. An example string looks 
 something like "IRQ=7 IO=0x220"

Template: ethdetect/load_module
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Would you like me to attempt to load the '${module}' module?
 An ethernet card has been detected on the ${bus} bus.  In order for the operating
 system to use this card the module '${module}' must be loaded.

Template: ethdetect/error
Type: note
Description: An error occured.
 Something went wrong. 

Template: ethdetect/nothing_detected
Type: note
Description: No ethernet cards were detected.
 Make sure the card is firmly seated and try again.
