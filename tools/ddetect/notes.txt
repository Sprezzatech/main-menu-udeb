Questions:


1. What constitutes passive/active detection?

diskdetect: what info do people really want?  size, device?
cddetect:  what about the thing in the hardware list that calls itself an isa/ide cdrom? 
cpudetect : ppc, alpha, i386
ethdetect:
mdmdetect: need to test it

pcmcia: anything special here?
