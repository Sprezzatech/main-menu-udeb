* perhaps probe to see if the module can actually be loaded before bugging the user for any more information?

* set up anything that needs doing so the modules will be automatically loaded when we reboot
  (insert  $MODNAME into /etc/modules)

* probe the card to see if the modules is already loaded

* clean up the return values, decide what is really a failure, and how to handle it

* should we try to detect ISA devices?

* if it's a PCI module, don't prompt them for parameters (does that work for all PCI modules?)
