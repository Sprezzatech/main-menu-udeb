kernel-chooser (0.01) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * First release.
  * André Luís Lopes :
    - Converted template to be managed by po-debconf suite.
    - Added debian/po/output file so utf8 will be used by templates.
    - Added pt_BR (brazilian portuguese) template translation.
    - Bumped Build-Depends-Indep on debhelper version (>= 4.1.13) to
      (>= 4.1.16) to ensure UTF-8 templates. Build-Depends-Indep on
      po-debconf (>= 0.5.0) was already set.
    - Add menu item number 66 to get it between base-installer and
      kernel-installer.
