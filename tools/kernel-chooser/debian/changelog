kernel-chooser (0.01) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * First release.
  * André Luís Lopes :
    - Converted template to be managed by po-debconf suite.
    - Added debian/po/output file so utf8 will be used by templates.
    - Added pt_BR (brazilian portuguese) template translation.
    - Bumped Build-Depends-Indep on debhelper version (>= 4.1.13) to
      (>= 4.1.16) to ensure UTF-8 templates. Build-Depends-Indep on
      po-debconf (>= 0.5.0) was already set.
  * Add menu item number 66 to get it between base-installer and
    kernel-installer.
  * Use 'cut' instead of 'awk', as 'awk' is missing in busybox.
  * Fix typos in postinst script.
  * Add code to keep going if 'uniq' is missing.
  * Remove 'sort -r' until busybox supports it.
  * Add logging.
  * Report a critical problem if there are no kernels available.
  * Add Norwegian Nynorsk (nn.po), thanks to Gaute Hvoslef Kvalnes.
  * Added debian/po/POTFILES.in to get debconf2po-update working.
