This package (kernel-chooser) will look at the current architecture,
distribution and possibly /proc/cpuinfo, and choose the best kernel
among the packages implementing the virtual package kernel-image.  The
name of the kernel is stored into debian-installer/kernel/image and
the correct package is installed by kernel-installer.
