languagechooser (0.013) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Denis Barbier:
    - Add debian/po/output file to convert templates into UTF-8
    - Add backup capabilities to languagechooser
    - Managing country list seems not obvious, only countries which
      provide Debian mirrors are printed.  This criterion may change
      later.
    - Replace parens by brackets in language list, because parens are
      displayed with some country names.  The iso-codes package contains
      translations of many language and country names.
    - Add support for multiple languages.
    - Make debconf/language question an alias to debian-installer/language
    - French debconf templates, by Pierre Machard.
  * Martin Sjögren
    - Provide language-selected

languagechooser (0.012) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed to use Architecture: all.
  * Corrected build-dep.  No need to depend on libcdebconf-dev any more.
  * Change menu item from 25 to 10.
  * Remove translated description from debian/control.  lintian
    complains, so this must be the wrong place for it.
  * Use language part from locale if language-name question fails.
  * Denis Barbier:
    - Converted to use po-debconf.  A dependency against po-debconf >= 0.6.0
      is needed because language list choice has 2 leading underscores.
    - Language selection is performed by the debian-installer/language-name
      question, debian-installer/language only contains language code.
  * André Luís Lopes :
    - Add pt_BR template translation.
