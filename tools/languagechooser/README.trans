Important note to languagechooser translators :

When translating languagechooser's debian/language-name options, only the
language name should be translated, not the language code. An example
follows :

'de [German]' should read 'de [Alemão]' when one is translating
to Brazilian Portuguese. The 'de' part should be left as is.

The iso-codes package contains translations for language and country
names.
