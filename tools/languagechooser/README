debian-installer language chooser
=================================

The purpose of languagechooser is to ask the person doing the
installation about his preferred language.  This information can be
used to choose which language to use during installation and set this
language as the default language after the installation.

This package should behave as follows:

  0. Ask the user to pick one of the available languages.

  1. Change presentation language in debconf.

  2. If the language is available in several variants / regions, ask
     which of the available regions the user wants to use.  (allow
     user to [back] off to the language list.)

  3. pass the locale information on to the modules that needs it.

Based on this information a locale is selected.  This locale maps to
one language, one region, a priority list of fallback languages.

The language code is passed into cdebconf.  The locale and priority
list of languages is passed to base-config/termwrap as LANG_INST and
LANGUAGE_INST in /target/root/dbootstrap_settings.

For each supported locale, the following information must be
available:

  - language code (part of locale)
  - country code (part of locale)
  - priority list of fallback languages to use as translations

If LANG (locale) and/or LANGAUGE (priority list of language codes) was
passed as arguments to the kernel from the boot prompt, these values
should be used instead of presenting the user with questions.

There have been request for the possibility of editing the priority
list of language codes to use.  This might be done, with debconf
priority 'low' to make sure the question will be invisible for most
users.  I [pere 2003-02-28] do not think this is needed in the general
installation, and will keep it out of the first version.

--------

The language chooser in boot-floppies contains some logic to make a
list of languages and variants available.  We need to check if we can
reuse the code and information.

Information passed into other modules
-------------------------------------

  cdebconf

   - (List of?) language codes to use when choosing which translation
     to use.  Inserted into the 'debconf/language' debconf template.

  kbd-chooser

   - Selects default keyboard based on the locale selected.  This information
     is passed on to base-config and console-tools.

  choose-mirror

   - Should the default country/mirror be configured using the
     selected language/locale?

  base-config

   - Locale and list of language codes to use when choosing
     translations.  This is placed in
     /target/root/dbootstrap_settings, like this:

       LANG_INST=locale
       LANGUAGE_INST=code:code:code:code
