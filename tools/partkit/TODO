* support non-i386 archs, the boot floppies partitioner has some ifdef's
  for arm etc. that should be integrated
* menutest might be too simple, is that all we want?
* decide on an automatic partitioning scheme, perhaps find the total space
  on all available drives and divide it up somehow between  / , /usr, /var
  /home ?
* get partitions needs to be more intelligent
* fix error handling.  currently we are bailing out completely at even the
  slightest error.  Some of these errors aren't fatal and shouldn't be
  treated as such.
* when prompting for primary/logical/extended the user may not actually be
  able to make one of them, don't offer it if it won't be possible.
