_Description: System reboot
 The system will now reboot.
 .
 Before this reboot occurs, you'll need to make sure you are booting
 from the right media.
 .
 If you are booting from the local disk, check that there are no
 floppies in the floppy drives and no CD-ROM in the tray.  If you made
 a custom boot floppy and want to boot from it, you should put that
 floppy in the first floppy drive.
 .
 You may also restart the installation system by booting from your
 installation media.
 .
 Please take care of all that before you continue.
