_Description: The machine will now reboot.
 When you reboot the system, you'll need to make sure you are booting
 from the right media.
 .
 If you are booting from the local disk, make sure there are no
 floppies in the floppy drives and no CD-ROM in the tray.  If you made
 a custom boot floppy and want to boot from that, you should put that
 floppy in the first floppy drive.  Finally, you can restart the
 installation system by booting from your install media.
 .
 Please take care of all that before you continue.
