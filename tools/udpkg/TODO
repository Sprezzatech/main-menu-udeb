* support --unpack and --configure (-u and -c -- code is there, not yet tested)
* detect Pre-Depends and treat them as just a continuation of the Depends
  line
* make status file writing actually work. Current issues:
	- dpkg_unpackcontrol contains code to pull the versions,
	depends, and provides fields out of the control file, but this code
	is really a duplicate of the code in status_read, plus is is broken
	(it gets everything after "Version: ", which includes most of the
	control file... so weird and ugly things are written when those
	fields are printed.
	- we seem to be inserting too many \n's.
	- we seem to be losing some fields that were in the file before,
	  when printing out packages from the tree. Namely, the Status
	  field.
	
* make status file writing include short description, and any translated
  short descriptions
