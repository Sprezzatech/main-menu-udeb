* make status file read/write preserve any localized short descriptions
* Install a deb that has a failing postinst (libc6.deb into the demo system
  works well, and you see something like:

  ldconfig: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission denied
  postinst exited with status 256
  /mirror/debian/all/libc6_2.2-5.deb: No such file or directory

  The last line seems bogus, it did install the file after all.
