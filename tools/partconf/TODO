TODO list for partconf
======================

* Friendlier info than /dev/ide/...

* Default values need to be set
  - Main menu should iterate over every partition
  - Existing filesystem default should always be "leave it be"
  - Mount point should be smarter

* Turn off backup at certain points to avoid silly things

* There are probably things that can break that are not handled

* Do sanity checks like double mount directly

* Verify that opening EVMS/RAID volumes as disks to find size and
  file system type works (I have tested it for LVM)

* Sanity checks for trying to use LVM/EVMS/RAID host partitions
  directly
