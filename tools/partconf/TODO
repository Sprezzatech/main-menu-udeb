TODO list for partconf
======================

* Friendlier info than /dev/ide/...

* Default values need to be set
  - Main menu should iterate over every partition
  - Existing filesystem default should always be "leave it be"
  - Mount point should be smarter

* Turn off backup at certain points to avoid silly things

* There are probably things that can break that are not handled

* Do sanity checks like double mount directly

* Open LVM volumes et.c. as disks to figure out file system
