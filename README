sprezzos-installer ('s-i') was forked from the debian-installer ('d-i')
project on 2012-08-13, using git-svn.

How to get started?
===================

  To check out d-i, you will need Git, as well as the 'mr' command.
  'mr' is in the 'mr' package, or see <http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/mr/>.

  First, check out the git repository.

     git clone https://github.com/dankamongmen/s-i.git

  Now run these commands to check out the rest of the installer, from git:

     cd s-i
     scripts/git-setup
     mr -p checkout (or 'mr -c .mrconfig checkout' on systems with mr below version 1.00)

  Then see the docs in s-i/installer/doc. If you just want to build
  bootable images, see s-i/installer/build/README. If you don't
  understand something, post to sprezzos-dev@googlegroups.com.
