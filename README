    --------------------------------------------------------------
      This is the main directory of the debian-installer project.
    --------------------------------------------------------------

It is coordinated on the debian-boot mailing list debian-boot@lists.debian.org
(Go to http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe#debian-boot to subscribe).

How to get started?
===================

  For Debian developers:
  ----------------------
  
     cvs -d:ext:<username>@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot co debian-installer
  
  For non-DDs:
  ------------
  
     cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot login
     cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot co debian-installer
  
  Then "cd debian-installer/doc" and read everything (suggested order: README,
  goals.txt, design.txt, modules.txt, retreiver.txt, ui.txt, walkthrough.txt,
  TODO). If you don't understand something, post to the list.

=============

  Every day at 2 pm (PST), joeyh is autobuilding a debian-installer image
  from whatever is in the archive. The daily builds will end up at

  log from the last build will be at
