    --------------------------------------------------------------
      This is the main directory of the debian-installer project.
    --------------------------------------------------------------

It is coordinated on the debian-boot mailing list, debian-boot@lists.debian.org
(Go to http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe#debian-boot to subscribe).

How to get started?
===================

  To check out d-i, you will need both Subversion and Git, as well as the `mr`
  command. `mr` is in the `mr` package, or see
  <http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/mr/`

  First, check out the svn repository. If you have an account on alioth,
  use ssh:

     svn co svn+ssh://<username>@svn.d-i.alioth.debian.org/svn/d-i/trunk d-i

  Or for an anonymous checkout:

     svn co svn+ssh://<username>@svn.d-i.alioth.debian.org/svn/d-i/trunk d-i

  Now run these commands to check out the rest of the installer, from git:

     cd d-i
     scripts/git-setup
     mr -p checkout

  Then see the docs in d-i/installer/doc. If you just want to build
  bootable images, see d-i/installer/build/README. If you don't
  understand something, post to debian-boot@lists.debian.org.

Daily builds:
=============

  See http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer for locations
  of daily built images.
