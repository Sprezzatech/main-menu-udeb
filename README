This is the main directory of the debian-installer project.
It is coordinated via the debian-boot mailing list debian-boot@lists.debian.org
(Go to http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe#debian-boot to subscribe).

How to get started?

For Debian developers:

   cvs -d:ext:<username>@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot co debian-installer

For non-DDs:
   cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot login
   cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot co debian-installer

Then "cd debian-installer/doc" and read everything (suggested order: README,
goals.txt, design.txt, modules.txt, retreiver.txt, ui.txt, walkthrough.txt,
TODO). If you don't understand something, post to the list.
