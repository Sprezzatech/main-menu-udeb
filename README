How to get started?
===================

  For Debian developers:
  ----------------------
  
     cvs -d:ext:<username>@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot co debian-installer
  
  For non-DDs:
  ------------
  
     cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot co debian-installer

  For CVS-less access:
  --------------------

     wget http://people.debian.org/~kraai/debian-installer.tar.gz
     tar xzf debian-installer.tar.gz
  
  Then "cd debian-installer/doc" and read everything (suggested order:
  README, goals.txt, design.txt, ../build/README, modules.txt,
  retriever.txt, ui.txt, walkthrough.txt, TODO). If you don't understand
  something, post to the list.
