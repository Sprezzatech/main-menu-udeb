* Release files

* Dependencies. If you select package A, which depends on B, B should be
  automatically selected. If A depends on B|C (a virtual package), at least
  one of them should be selected.

* cleanup command for retrievers

* configure retrievers and remove 'retriever' dependency

* Better error-resistance. One failing package shouldn't shoot everything.

* Sane default for retriever choice. Ideally, cdrom-retriever for CD installs
  and net-retriever for network installs.
