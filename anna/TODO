* Release files

* Better error-resistance. One failing package shouldn't shoot everything.

* "Tasks". Only list udebs that have a certain control field. Use the contents
  of that control field as info in the list. Other udebs will be pulled in by
  dependencies.

* Instead of displaying a generic "no modules" template, call a method of
  the retreiver, which can display its own explaination of why the
  retreval failed.

* Break out the retreiver selection prompt and all the associated code into 
  the load-installer program, there is no reason to keep it in anna, and
  it's just wasting space on the root floppy.

* Get rid of the ugly and fragile hack that parses package names to try to
  detect kernel module udebs and only install ones for the current kernel,
  and replace it with proper dependency checking. Throw out udebs whose
  deps cannot be met.
