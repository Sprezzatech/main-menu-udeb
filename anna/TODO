* Release files

* configure retrievers and remove 'retriever' dependency

* Better error-resistance. One failing package shouldn't shoot everything.

* "Tasks". Only list udebs that have a certain control field. Use the contents
of that control field as info in the list. Other udebs will be pulled in by
dependencies.
