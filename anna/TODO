* Release files

* Progress bar support

* configure retrievers and remove 'retriever' dependency

* Better error-resistance. One failing package shouldn't shoot everything.

* Sane default for retriever choice. Ideally, cdrom-retriever for CD installs
  and net-retriever for network installs.

* Module selection, something like
    1. List modules to be installed
    2. Select modules to be installed
    3. Done (default)
  Stress the fact that many modules will be installed automatically.
