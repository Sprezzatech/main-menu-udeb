Description: Debian-Installer loader for win32
 This package provides a win32 program that can be used as a loader for
 Debian Installer, acting as a more user-friendly boot mechanism than
 traditional BIOS-based boot.
 .
 It can act as a standalone netboot loader (for a practical example, see
 http://goodbye-microsoft.com/), or as a cdrom/usb-disk add-on that starts
 a media-based install.
