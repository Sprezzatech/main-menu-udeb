<para>

If you have booted from SRM, if you select this option, the installer
will write <command>aboot</command> to the first sector of the disk on
which you installed Debian.  Be <emphasis>very</emphasis> careful - it
is <emphasis>not</emphasis> possible to boot multiple operating
systems (e.g. GNU/Linux, Free/Open/NetBSD, OSF/1 a.k.a. Digital Unix
a.k.a. Tru64 Unix, or OpenVMS) from the same disk.  If you also have a
different operating system installed on the disk where you have
installed Debian, you will have to boot GNU/Linux from a floppy
instead.

If you have booted from <command>MILO</command>, the installer will
attempt to find a FAT-formatted partition and copy
<filename>linload.exe</filename> and the <filename>MILO</filename>
binary there.
