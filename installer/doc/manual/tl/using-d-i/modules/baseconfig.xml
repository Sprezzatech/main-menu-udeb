   <title>Running <command>base-config</command> From Within &d-i;</title>

<para>

It is possible to configure the base system within the first stage
installer (before rebooting from the hard drive), by running
<command>base-config</command> in a <firstterm>chroot</firstterm>
environment. This is mainly useful for testing the installer and a
vast majority of people should avoid it.
