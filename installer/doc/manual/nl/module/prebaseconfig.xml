   <sect3 id="prebaseconfig"><title>Finish the Installation and Reboot</title>
<para>

This is the last step in the initial Debian installation process. You will
be prompted to remove the boot media (CD, floppy, etc) that you used to
boot the installer. The installer will do any last minute tasks, and then
reboot into your new Debian system.
