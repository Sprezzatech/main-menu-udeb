TODO for the ng-build-scripts
-----------------------------

- make tables work as they should in the newPDF and newPS versions

- implement some easy format-dependant dir structure for the -d option,
  something like "/tmp/manual/%l/%a/%f" to get everything into
  /tmp/manual/<lang>/<arch>/<format>
