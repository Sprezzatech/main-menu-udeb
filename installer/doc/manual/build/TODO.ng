TODO for the ng-build-scripts
-----------------------------

- make tables work as they should in the newPDF and newPS versions	

2005-01-24: they do now, the original DocBook files need to get patched
to define the columns like they should

- implement some easy format-dependant dir structure for the -d option,
  something like "/tmp/manual/%l/%a/%f" to get everything into
  /tmp/manual/<lang>/<arch>/<format>
