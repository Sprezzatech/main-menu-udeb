1. Requirements:
================

docbook, docbook-xml, docbook-xsl, xsltproc, (fop)


2. Included Files:
==================

install.en.xml: Main xml file used to aggregate various parts into
                one big whole. This is a bit customized compared to
                the original (changed SYSTEM entities, hardcode local
                path to docbook dtd -- broken system xml catalogs?)
                Feel free to add your local install.xx.xml.

common.ent: Contains various entities like &num-of-distrib-packages;
            &debian; &arch-title; ...

urls.ent: Contains various urls used through the manual.

docstruct.ent: Describes physical structure of documentation. Not
               included directly (because of hardcoded en/ path), but
               in a form of dynamic.ent (after some path replacing by sed).

dynamic.ent: Generated on-the-fly from the shell script buildone.sh.
             Contains lang and arch specific entities which can't be
             profiled the usual xml way.

any other .ent: Location of installation files (kernels, boot disks,
                base tarballs) for various architectures.

buildone.sh: For given architecture and language builds one set of
             documentation in .html, .fo (and sometimes .pdf).

build.sh: For each language and architecture calls buildone.sh, moves
          rendered documentation somewhere and cleans after that.

clear.sh: Does the actual cleaning.

style-common.xsl: Common parameters for xsl transformation.

style-html.xsl: HTML-specific parameters for xsl transformation.

style-fo.xsl: FO-specific parameters for xsl transformation.


3. Building:
============

After you customize build*.sh and style-*.xsl to suit your needs
(esp. various paths), you can run

 ./buildone.sh sparc en

to build documentation for one specific architecture (sparc) and
language (en). For mass building you can use ./build.sh script.
