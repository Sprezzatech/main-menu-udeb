<para>

Complete information regarding supported mips/mipsel machines can be
found at <ulink url="&url-mips-howto;">Linux MIPS HOWTO</ulink>. The
purpose of this section is to describe the systems supported by the
boot disks.

<para>

Currently only DECstations with R3000 and R4000/R4400 CPUs are 
supported by the Debian installation system on little endian MIPS.
The Debian installation system works on the following machines:

Linux/MIPS also works on the DECstation 5000/200, but this is not
supported by the Debian installation system currently.

   <sect3><title>Supported console options</title>
<para>

Serial console is available on all supported DECstations (9600 bps,
8N1). For using serial console, you have to boot the installer image
with the "console=ttySx" kernel parameter (with "x" being the number
of the serial port you have your terminal connected to - usually "2",
but "0" for the Personal DECstations).  On 3MIN and 3MAX+ (DECstation
5000/1xx, 5000/240 and 5000/260) local console is available with the
PMAG-BA and the PMAGB-B graphics options.

If you would like to have support for other subarchitectures, please
contact the 
<ulink url="&url-list-subscribe;">debian-mips mailing list</ulink>.

</para><para>

If you have a Linux system to use as serial terminal, an easy way
is to run cu (part of the <classname>uucp</classname> package) on it.
Example:

<informalexample><screen>

cu -l /dev/ttyS1 -s 9600

</screen></informalexample>

</para><para>

where the option "-l" (line) sets the serial port to use and "-s" (speed)
sets the speed for the connection (9600 bits per second).
