<title>Preconfiguration File Example</title>

<para>

This is a complete working example of a preconfiguration file for an automated
install. Its use is explained in <xref linkend="automatic-install"/>. You
may want to uncomment some of the lines before using the file.

In order to be able to properly present this example in the manual, we've had
to split some lines. This is indicated by the use of the line-continuation-character
<quote>\</quote> and extra indentation in the next line. In a real preconfiguration
file, these split lines have to be joined into <emphasis>one single line</emphasis>.
If you do not, preconfiguration will fail with unpredictable results.

A <quote>clean</quote> example file is included on the official Debian
installation CD-ROMs in <filename>/doc/install/manual</filename> and available from
the Internet at <ulink url="&url-example-preseed;"></ulink>.
