For installing on multiple computers it's possible to do fully
automatic installations. Debian packages intended for this include
<classname>fai</classname> (which uses an install server),
<classname>replicator</classname>,
<classname>systemimager</classname>,

<classname>the Debian Installer</classname>.

<title>Automatic installation using the Debian Installer</title>

<para>
The Debian Installer supports automating installs via preconfiguration
files. A preconfiguration file can be loaded from the network or from
removable media, and used to fill in answers to question asked during the
installation process.

</para><para>

The preconfiguration file is in the format used by the
debconf-set-selections command. The easiest way to generate a
preconfiguration file is to do a manual install, and then use
debconf-get-selections to dump both the debconf database and the cdebconf
database in /var/log/debian-installer/cdebconf to a single file:

<informalexample><screen>
debconf-get-selections --installer > file
debconf-get-selections >> file
</screen></informalexample>

Once you have a preconfiguation file, you can edit it if necessary, and
place it on a web server, or copy it onto the installer's boot media. Wherever
you place the file, you need to pass a parameter to the installer at boot
time to tell it to use the file.

To make the installer use a preconfiguration file download from the
network, add preseed/url=http://url/to/config to the kernel boot parameters.
Of course the preconfiguration will not take effect until the installer
manages to set up the network to download the file, so this is most useful
if the installer can set up the network via DHCP without asking any
questions. You may want to set the installation priority to critical to
avoid any questions while the network is being configured.

To place a preconfiguration file on a CD, you would need to remaster the
ISO image to include your preconfiguraton file. See the manual page for
mkisofs for details.

If you'll be booting from a USB memory stick, then you can simply copy your
preconfiguration file onto the memory stick's filesystem, and edit the
syslinux.cfg file to add preseed/file=/hd-media/config to the kernel boot
parameters.
