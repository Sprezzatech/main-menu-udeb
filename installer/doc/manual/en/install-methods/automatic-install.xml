 <title>Automatic Installation</title>
<para>

For installing on multiple computers it's possible to do fully
automatic installations. Debian packages intended for this include
<classname>fai</classname> (which uses an install server),
<classname>replicator</classname>,
<classname>systemimager</classname>,
<classname>autoinstall</classname>, and
<classname>debian-installer</classname>.

Well, there isn't really much to read; I think I've summarized my experiences
a few times, but of course I can do it again (a bit short, though):

- cdebconf preseeding works very well; the latest cdebconf should also work
  correctly wrt. automated installs (debconf/showold = false by default), it
  was broken for a while. I just add the cdebconf database to the
  installation media, and use a custom udeb or two (which can be found at
  http://people.debian.org/~sesse/, but should probably be cleaned up some).
  The simplest way to get this database is to install manually once, then
  prune the cdebconf database manually and just insert it in the right place.
- Partitioning is done with autopartkit, also works well at least for my
  purposes. I think partman can do something like this as well.
- Likewise, debconf preseeding works well; one of my udebs drop some
  base-config fragments in the right place which skip the root password
  generation etc. and pop the right info into the debconf database, as well
  as install a metapackage depending on whatever I want. (In the future, I'll
  probably use pkgsync for this; see my ITP on `pkgsync'. :-) )

Let me know if you're wondering about something more specific. Note that I
haven't been able to touch d-i in a month or two, so I don't know how
broken/working automated installs are ATM. :-)

We have not yet refined automatic installs with the debian-installer, but
here's the essence of how it would work:
</para>

<para>
Do a Manual install.
</para>

<para>
Save the answers from the debconf database,
 <filename>/var/log/debian-installer/cdebconf</filename>,
 into a file.
</para>

<para>
Put the file in a preseeding udeb.
