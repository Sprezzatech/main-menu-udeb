   <title>Country selection</title>

<para>

If you selected a language in <xref linkend="lang-chooser"/> which has
more than one country associated with it (true for Chinese, English,
French, and many other languages), you can specify the country here.
If you choose <guimenuitem>Other</guimenuitem> at the bottom of the list,
you will be presented with a list of all countries, grouped by continent.

This selection will be used later in the installation process to pick the
default timezone and a Debian mirror appropriate for your geographic
location. If the defaults proposed by the installer are not suitable, you
can make a different choice. The selected country, together with the selected
language, may also affect locale settings for your new Debian system.
