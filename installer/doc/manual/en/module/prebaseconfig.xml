   <title>Finish the Installation and Reboot</title>

<para>

This is the last step in the initial Debian installation process. You will
be prompted to remove the boot media (CD, floppy, etc) that you used to
boot the installer. The installer will do any last minute tasks, and then
reboot into your new Debian system.

Select the <guimenuitem>Finish the installation</guimenuitem>
menu item which will halt the system
because rebooting is not supported on &arch-title; in this case. You
then need to IPL GNU/Linux from the DASD which you selected for the
root filesystem during the first steps of the installation.
