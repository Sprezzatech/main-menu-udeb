<para>

Now it is time to partition your disks. If you are uncomfortable with
partitioning, or just want to know more details, see <xref
linkend="partitioning"/>.

</para><para>

First you will be given the opportunity to automatically partition
either an entire drive, or free space on a drive. This is also called
<quote>guided</quote> partitioning. If you do not want to
autopartition, choose <guimenuitem>Manually edit partition
table</guimenuitem> from the menu and skip to the next
paragraph. Otherwise you will be asked if you want <guimenuitem>All
files in one partition</guimenuitem>, <guimenuitem>Separate partition
for home directories</guimenuitem>, or if you rather plan to have
a <guimenuitem>Multi-user system</guimenuitem>. All schemes have their
pros and cons, some of which are discussed in <xref
linkend="partitioning"/>. If you are unsure, choose the first
one. Bear in mind, that guided partitioning needs certain minimal
amount of free space to operate with. If you don't give it at least
about 1GB of space (depends on chosen scheme), guided partitioning
will fail.

On the next screen you will see your partition table, how the
partitions will be formatted, and where they will be mounted.
If you did automatic partitioning, you should just be able to choose
<guimenuitem>Finished partitioning</guimenuitem> from the menu to use
what it set up.

</para><para arch="ia64">

If you chose an automatic partitioning for your IA64 system, there
will be an additional partition, formatted as a FAT16 bootable filesystem,
for the EFI boot loader.
There is also an additional menu item in the formatting menu to manually
set up a partition as an EFI boot partition.

The list of partitions might look like this:

<!-- TODO: show some flags here (lightning, skull, smiley) -->
<informalexample><screen>
  IDE1 master (hda) - 6.4 GB WDC AC36400L
        #1 primary   16.4 MB    ext2   /boot

        #3 primary    5.8 GB    ntfs

        #1 primary   15.9 MB    ext3
        #2 primary  996.0 MB    fat16

As you can see, there are two IDE harddrives divided to several
partitions. Each partition line consists of the partition number, its
type, size, optional flags, file system, and mountpoint (if any).

</para><para>

If you select a pristine disk which doesn't have neither partitions
nor free space on it, you will be offered to create a new partition
table (this is needed so you can create new partitions). After this
a new line entitled <quote>FREE SPACE</quote> should appear under the
selected disk.

</para><para>

If you select some free space, you will be offered to create new
partition. You will have to answer a quick series of questions about
its size, type (primary or logical), and location (begining or end of
the free space). After this, you will be presented with detailed
overview of your new partition. There are options like mountpoint,
mount options, bootable flag, or way of usage. If you don't like the
preselected defaults, feel free to change them to your liking. E.g. by
selecting the option <guimenuitem>Use as:</guimenuitem>, you can
choose different filesystem for this partition including the
possibility to use the partition for swap, software RAID, LVM, or not
use it at all. Other nice feature is the possibility to copy data from
existing partition onto this one.
When you are satisfied with your new partition, select
<guimenuitem>Finished with partition</guimenuitem> and you will be
thrown back to the <command>partman</command>'s main screen.

</para><para>

If you decide you want to change something about your partition,
simply select the partition, which will bring you to the partition
configuration menu. Because this is the same screen like when creating
a new partition, you can change the same set of options. One thing
which might not be very obvious at a first glance is that you can
resize the partition by selecting the item displaying the size of the
partition. Filesystems known to work are at least fat16, fat32, ext2,
ext3 and swap. If you don't like the partition at all, you can delete
it from this menu.

</para><para>

The partitioning menu also has a choice at
the top that can be used to automatically partition a drive or
existing free space on a drive, if you'd rather go that route. Be sure
to create at least two partitions, one for <emphasis>swap</emphasis>
and one for the <emphasis>root</emphasis> filesystem (which must be
mounted as <filename>/</filename>). If you forget to mount the root
filesystem, <command>partman</command> won't let you continue until
you correct this issue. However, this situation should not happen,
because <command>partman</command> by default offers reasonable
defaults.

</para><para arch="ia64">

If you forget to select and format an EFI boot partition
<command>partman</command> will detect this and will not let you continue
until you allocate one.

</para><para>

Capabilities of <command>partman</command> can be extended with
installer modules, so if you can't see all promised goodies, check if
you have loaded all required modules
(e.g. <filename>partman-ext3</filename>,
<filename>partman-xfs</filename>, or
<filename>partman-lvm</filename>).

</para><para>

After you are satisfied with partitioning, select <guimenuitem>Finished
partitioning</guimenuitem> from the partitioning menu. You will be
presented with a summary of changes made to the disks and asked to
confirm that the filesystems should be created as requested.
