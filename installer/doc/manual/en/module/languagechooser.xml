<para>

As the first step of the installation, select the language in which
you want the installation process to proceed. Some languages have
variants available.  Pick whichever variant applies to your geographic
region.

</para><para>

The language you choose will be used for the rest of the installation
process, provided a translation of the different dialogs is available.
If no valid translation is available for the selected language, the
installer will default to English. The selected language will also be
used to help select a suitable keyboard layout.
