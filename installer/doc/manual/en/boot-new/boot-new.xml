 <title>Booting Into Your New Debian System</title>

 <sect1><title>Make System Bootable</title>
<para>

Note that multiple operating systems booting on a single machine is
still something of a black art.  This document does not even attempt
to document the various boot managers, which vary by architecture and
even by subarchitecture.   You should see your boot manager's
documentation for more information.

  <sect2 condition="supports-nfsroot"><title>Diskless Workstations</title>
<para>

If you are installing a diskless workstation, obviously, booting off
the local disk isn't a meaningful option, and this step will be
skipped. <phrase arch="sparc">You may wish to set the OpenBoot to boot
from the network by default; see <xref
linkend="boot-dev-select-sun"/>.</phrase>

 <sect1 id="make-boot-floppy"><title>Making a Boot Floppy</title>
<para>

You may wish to make a boot floppy even if you intend to boot the
system from the hard disk. The reason for this is that it's possible
for the hard disk bootstrap to be mis-installed, but a boot floppy
will almost always work.

</para><para>

Feed the system a blank floppy as directed. Make sure the floppy isn't
write-protected, as the software will format and write it. Mark this
the <quote>Custom Boot</quote> floppy and write-protect it once it has
been written.

</para><para>

This floppy will contain a kernel and a simple file system, with a
directive to use your new root file system.

</para><para arch="alpha">

Unfortunately, a boot floppy can only be made for SRM systems, since
<command>MILO</command> won't fit together with a kernel on a single
floppy.

</para>

 <sect1 id="base-boot"><title>The Moment of Truth</title>
<para>

You system's first boot on its own power is what electrical engineers
call the <quote>smoke test</quote>.

</para><para arch="s390">

Select the ``Reboot the System'' menu item which will halt the system
because rebooting is not supported on &arch-title; in this case. You
then need to IPL GNU/Linux from the DASD which you selected for the
root filesystem during the first steps of the installation.

</para><para>

If you are booting directly into Debian, and the system doesn't start
up, either use your original installation boot media (for instance,
the rescue floppy), or insert the custom boot floppy if you created
one, and reset your system.  If you are <emphasis>not</emphasis> using
the custom boot floppy, you will probably need to add some boot
arguments.  If booting with the rescue floppy or similar technique,
you need to specify
<userinput>rescue root=<replaceable>root</replaceable></userinput>,
where <replaceable>root</replaceable> is your root partition, such as
<filename>/dev/sda1</filename>.

</para>

  <sect2 arch="m68k"><title>VME6000 Booting</title>
<para>

If you have just performed a diskless install on a BVM or Motorola
VMEbus machine: once the system has loaded the
<command>tftplilo</command> program from the TFTP server, from the
<prompt>LILO Boot:</prompt> prompt enter one of:

to boot a BVME4000/6000

  <sect2 arch="m68k"><title>Macintosh Booting</title>

<para>

Go to the directory containing the installation files and start up the
<command>Penguin</command> booter, holding down the
<keycap>command</keycap> key.  Go to the
<userinput>Settings</userinput> dialogue (<keycombo>
<keycap>command</keycap> <keycap>T</keycap> </keycombo>), and locate
the kernel options line which should look like
<userinput>root=/dev/ram video=font:VGA8x16</userinput> or similar.

</para><para>

You need to change the entry to
<userinput>root=/dev/<replaceable>yyyy</replaceable></userinput>.
Replace the <replaceable>yyyy</replaceable> with the Linux name of the
partition onto which you installed the system
(e.g. <filename>/dev/sda1</filename>); you wrote this down earlier.
The <userinput>video=font:VGA8x8</userinput> is recommended especially
for users with tiny screens. The kernel would pick a prettier (6x11)
font but the console driver for this font can hang the machine, so
using 8x16 or 8x8 is safer at this stage.  You can change this at any
time.

</para><para>

If you don't want to start GNU/Linux immediately each time you start,
uncheck the <userinput>Auto Boot</userinput> option. Save your
settings in the <filename>Prefs</filename> file using the
<userinput>Save Settings As Default</userinput> option.

</para><para>

Now select <userinput>Boot Now</userinput> (<keycombo>
<keycap>command</keycap> <keycap>B</keycap> </keycombo>) to start your
freshly installed GNU/Linux instead of the RAMdisk installer system.

</para><para>

Debian should boot, and you should see the same messages as
when you first booted the installation system, followed by some new
messages.

 <sect1 id="base-config">
 <title>Debian Post-Boot (Base) Configuration</title>

<para>

After booting, you will be prompted to complete the configuration of
your basic system, and then to select what additional packages you
wish to install.  The application which guides you through this
process is called <classname>base-config</classname>. Its concept is
very similar to the &d-i; from the first stage.  Indeed,
<classname>base-config</classname> consists of a number of specialized
components, where each component handles one configuration task,
contains <quote>hidden menu in the background</quote> and also uses
the same navigation system.

</para><para>

If you wish to re-run the <classname>base-config</classname> at any
point after installation is complete, as root run
<userinput>base-config</userinput>.

 <sect1 id="login">
 <title>Log In</title>

<para>

After you've installed packages, you'll be presented with the login
prompt.  Log in using the personal login and password you
selected. Your system is now ready to use.

</para><para>

If you are a new user, you may want to explore the documentation which
is already installed on your system as you start to use it. There are
currently several documentation systems, work is proceeding on
integrating the different types of documentation. Here are a few
starting points.

</para><para>

Documentation accompanying programs you have installed is in
<filename>/usr/share/doc/</filename>, under a subdirectory named after
the program.  For example, the APT User's Guide for using
<command>apt</command> to install other programs on your system, is
located in
<filename>/usr/share/doc/apt/guide.html/index.html</filename>.

</para><para>

 
In addition, there are some special folders within the
<filename>/usr/share/doc/</filename> hierarchy. Linux HOWTOs are
installed in <emphasis>.gz</emphasis> format, in
<filename>/usr/share/doc/HOWTO/en-txt/</filename> and
<filename>/usr/share/doc/HOWTO/en-txt/mini/</filename>. The
<filename>/usr/share/doc/HTML/index.html</filename> contains
browse-able indexes of documentation installed by
<command>dhelp</command>.

</para><para>

One easy way to view these documents is to <userinput>cd
/usr/share/doc/</userinput>, and type <userinput>lynx</userinput>
followed by a space and a dot (the dot stands for the current
directory).

</para><para>

You can also type <userinput>info
<replaceable>command</replaceable></userinput> or <userinput>man
<replaceable>command</replaceable></userinput> to see documentation on
most commands available at the command prompt. Typing
<userinput>help</userinput> will display help on shell commands. And
typing a command followed by <userinput>--help</userinput> will
usually display a short summary of the command's usage. If a command's
results scroll past the top of the screen, type <userinput>|
more</userinput> after the command to cause the results to pause
before scrolling past the top of the screen. To see a list of all
commands available which begin with a certain letter, type the letter
and then two tabs.
