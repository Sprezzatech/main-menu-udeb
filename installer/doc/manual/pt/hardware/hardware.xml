 <title>Supported Hardware</title>

<para>

Debian does not impose hardware requirements beyond the requirements
of the Linux kernel and the GNU tool-sets.  Therefore, any
architecture or platform to which the Linux kernel, libc,
<command>gcc</command>, etc. have been ported, and for which a Debian
port exists, can run Debian. Please refer to the Ports pages at
<ulink url="&url-ports;"></ulink> for
more details on &arch-title; architecture systems which have been
tested with Debian.

</para><para>

Rather than attempting to describe all the different hardware
configurations which are supported for &arch-title;, this section
contains general information and pointers to where additional
information can be found.

</para>

  <sect2><title>Supported Architectures</title>

<para>

Debian &release; supports eleven major architectures and several
variations of each architecture known as 'flavors'.

This document covers installation for the
<emphasis>&arch-title;</emphasis> architecture.  If you are looking
for information on any of the other Debian-supported architectures
take a look at the
<ulink url="http://www.debian.org/ports/">Debian-Ports</ulink> pages.

</para><para condition="new-arch">

This is the first official release of &debian; for the &arch-title;
architecture.  We feel that it has proven itself sufficiently to be
released. However, because it has not had the exposure (and hence
testing by users) that some other architectures have had, you may
encounter a few bugs. Use our
<ulink url="&url-bts;">Bug Tracking System</ulink> to report any 
problems; make sure to mention the fact that the bug is on the
&arch-title; platform. It can be necessary to use the 
<ulink url="&url-list-subscribe;">debian-&architecture; mailing list</ulink>
as well.

<para>

Complete information regarding supported DEC Alphas can be found at
<ulink url="&url-alpha-howto;">Linux Alpha HOWTO</ulink>.  The
purpose of this section is to describe the systems supported
by the boot disks.

</para><para>

Alpha machines are subdivided into different system types because there
are a number of generations of motherboard and supporting chipsets.
Different systems (``sub-architectures'') often have radically different
engineering and capabilities.  Therefore, the process of installing and,
more to the point, booting, can vary from system to system.

</para><para>

The following table lists the system types supported by the Debian
installation system.  The table also indicates the <emphasis>code
name</emphasis> for these system types.  You'll need to know this code
name when you actually begin the installation process:

linloader. The RiscPC has a modular CPU card and typically has a 30MHz
610, 40MHz 710 or 233MHz Strongarm 110 CPU fitted. The mainboard has
integrated IDE, SVGA video, parallel port, single serial port, ps 2
keyboard and proprietary mouse port. The proprietary module expansion
bus allows for up to eight expansion cards to be fitted depending on
configuration, several of these modules have Linux drivers.

The are two major support <emphasis>&architecture;</emphasis> flavors:
PA-RISC 1.1 and PA-RISC 2.0.  The PA-RISC 1.1 architecture is targeted
at 32-bit processors whereas the 2.0 architecture is targeted to
the 64-bit processors.  Some systems are able to run either kernel.
In both cases, the userland is 32-bit.  There is the possibility of
a 64-bit userland in the future.

Nearly all x86-based processors are supported; this includes AMD and
VIA (former Cyrix) processors as well.  Also the new processors like
Athlon XP and Intel P4 Xeon are supported.  However, Linux will
<emphasis>not</emphasis> run on 286 or earlier processors.

<para>

The system bus is the part of the motherboard which allows the CPU to
communicate with peripherals such as storage devices.  Your computer
must use the ISA, EISA, PCI, the Microchannel Architecture (MCA, used
in IBM's PS/2 line), or VESA Local Bus (VLB, sometimes called the VL
bus).

The &architecture; port of Linux runs on any 680x0 with a PMMU (Paged
Memory Management Unit) and a FPU (floating-point unit).  This
includes the 68020 with an external 68851 PMMU, the 68030, and better,

<ulink url="&url-m68k-faq;">Linux/m68k FAQ</ulink> for complete details.

</para><para>

There are four major flavors of supported
<emphasis>&architecture;</emphasis> flavors: Amiga, Atari, Macintosh
and VME machines.  Amiga and Atari were the first two systems to which
Linux was ported; in keeping, they are also the two most
well-supported Debian ports.  The Macintosh line is supported
incompletely, both by Debian and by the Linux kernel; see 
<ulink url="&url-m68k-mac;">Linux m68k for Macintosh</ulink> for project
status and supported hardware.  The BVM and Motorola single board
VMEbus computers are the most recent addition to the list of machines
supported by Debian.  Ports to other &architecture; architectures,
such as the Sun3 architecture and NeXT black box, are underway but not
yet supported by Debian.

   <sect3><title>Supported console options</title>
<para>

Serial console is available on all supported DECstations (9600 bps,
8N1). For using serial console, you have to boot the installer image
with the "console=ttySx" kernel parameter (with "x" being the number
of the serial port you have your terminal connected to &mdash; usually "2",
but "0" for the Personal DECstations).  On 3MIN and 3MAX+ (DECstation
5000/1xx, 5000/240 and 5000/260) local console is available with the
PMAG-BA and the PMAGB-B graphics options.

</para><para>

If you have a Linux system to use as serial terminal, an easy way
is to run <command>cu</command><footnote>

<para>
In Woody this command was part of the <classname>uucp</classname> package,

</footnote> on it. Example:

<informalexample><screen>
$ cu -l /dev/ttyS1 -s 9600

where the option "-l" (line) sets the serial port to use and "-s" (speed)
sets the speed for the connection (9600 bits per second).

   <sect3><title>Power Macintosh (pmac) subarchitecture</title>

<para>

Apple (and briefly a few other manufacturers &mdash; Power Computing, for
example) makes a series of Macintosh computers based on the PowerPC
processor. For purposes of architecture support, they are categorized
as NuBus, OldWorld PCI, and NewWorld.

</para><para>

Macintosh computers using the 680x0 series of processors are not in
the PowerPC family but are instead m68k machines. Those models start 
with `Mac II' or have a 3-digit model number such as Centris 650
or Quadra 950. Apple's pre-iMac PowerPC model numbers have four digits.

</para><para>

NuBus systems are not currently supported by debian/powerpc. The
monolithic Linux/PPC kernel architecture does not have support for
these machines; instead, one must use the MkLinux Mach microkernel,
which Debian does not yet support. These include the following:

<itemizedlist>

OldWorld systems are most Power Macintoshes with a floppy drive and a
PCI bus. Most 603, 603e, 604, and 604e based Power Macintoshes are
OldWorld machines. The beige colored G3 systems are also OldWorld.

</para><para>

The so called NewWorld PowerMacs are any PowerMacs in translucent
colored plastic cases. That includes all iMacs, iBooks, G4 systems,
blue colored G3 systems, and most PowerBooks manufactured in and after
1999. The NewWorld PowerMacs are also known for using the `ROM in RAM'
system for MacOS, and were manufactured from mid-1998 onwards.

  <sect2 arch="sparc" id="sparc-cpus"><title>CPU, Main Boards, and Video Support</title>
<para>

Currently the <emphasis>&architecture;</emphasis> port supports
several types of Sparc systems. The most common identifiers for Sparc
systems are sun4, sun4c, sun4m, sun4d and sun4u. Currently we do not
support very old sun4 hardware. However, the other systems are
supported. Sun4d has been tested the least of these, so expect
possible problems with regard to the kernel stability. Sun4c and
Sun4m, the most common of the older Sparc hardware, includes such
systems as SparcStation 1, 1+, IPC, IPX and the SparcStation LX, 5,
10, and 20, respectively. The UltraSPARC class systems fall under the
sun4u identifier, and are supported using the sun4u set of install
images. Some systems that fall under these supported identifiers are
known to not be supported. Known unsupported systems are the AP1000
multicomputer and the Tadpole Sparcbook 1. See the 
<ulink url="&url-sparc-linux-faq;">Linux for SPARCProcessors FAQ</ulink> 
for complete information.

</para>

   <sect3><title>Memory Configuration</title>
<para>

Some older Sun workstations, notably the Sun IPX and Sun IPC have
memory banks located at fixed locations in physical memory.  Thus if
the banks are not filled gaps will exist in the physical memory space.
The Linux installation requires a contiguous memory block into which
to load the kernel and the initial RAMdisk.  If this is not available a
`Data Access Exception' will result.

</para><para>

Thus you must configure the memory so that the lowest memory block is
contiguous for at least 8Mb.  In the IPX and IPC cited above, memory banks
are mapped in at 16Mb boundaries.  In effect this means that you must have
a sufficiently large SIMM in bank zero to hold the kernel and RAMdisk.
In this case 4Mb is <emphasis>not</emphasis> sufficient.

</para><para>

Example:
In a Sun IPX you have a 16Mb SIMM and a 4Mb SIMM.  There are four
SIMM banks (0,1,2,3). [Bank zero is that furthest away from the SBUS
connectors]. You must therefore install the 16Mb SIMM in bank 0; it is
then recommended to install the 4Mb SIMM in bank 2. 

</para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3><title>Graphics Configuration</title>
<para>

Especially in the case of older Sun workstations, it is very common
for there to be an onboard framebuffer which has been superseded (for
example the bwtwo on a sun IPC), and an SBUS card containing a later
probably accelerated buffer is then plugged in to an SBUS slot.
Under Solaris/SunOS this causes no problems because both cards are
initialized.  

</para><para>

However with Linux this can cause a problem, in that the boot PROM
monitor may display its output on this additional card; however the
linux kernel boot messages may then be directed to the original on
board framebuffer, leaving <emphasis>no</emphasis> error messages on
the screen, with the machine apparently stuck loading the RAMdisk.

</para><para>

To avoid this problem, connect the monitor (if required) to the video
card in the lowest numbered SBUS slot (on motherboard card counts 
as below external slots).  Alternatively it is possible to use a serial
console.

  <sect2><title>Avoid Proprietary or Closed Hardware</title>
<para>

Some hardware manufacturers simply won't tell us how to write drivers
for their hardware. Others won't allow us access to the documentation
without a non-disclosure agreement that would prevent us from
releasing the Linux source code.

</para><para arch="m68k"> 

Another example is the proprietary hardware in the older
Macintosh line. In fact, no specifications or documentation have ever
been released for any Macintosh hardware, most notably the ADB
controller (used by the mouse and keyboard), the floppy controller,
and all acceleration and CLUT manipulation of the video hardware
(though we do now support CLUT manipulation on nearly all internal
video chips).  In a nutshell, this explains why the Macintosh Linux
port lags behind other Linux ports.

</para><para>

Since we haven't been granted access to the documentation on these
devices, they simply won't work under Linux. You can help by asking
the manufacturers of such hardware to release the documentation. If
enough people ask, they will realize that the free software community
is an important market.

</para>
</sect2>


  <sect2 arch="i386"><title>Windows-specific Hardware</title>
<para>

A disturbing trend is the proliferation of Windows-specific modems and
printers. In some cases these are specially designed to be operated by
the Microsoft Windows operating system and bear the legend
``WinModem'' or ``Made especially for Windows-based computers''. This
is generally done by removing the embedded processors of the hardware
and shifting the work they do over to a Windows driver that is run by
your computer's main CPU. This strategy makes the hardware less
expensive, but the savings are often <emphasis>not</emphasis> passed on to the
user and this hardware may even be more expensive than equivalent
devices that retain their embedded intelligence.

</para><para>

You should avoid Windows-specific hardware for two reasons. The first
is that the manufacturers do not generally make the resources
available to write a Linux driver. Generally, the hardware and
software interface to the device is proprietary, and documentation is
not available without a non-disclosure agreement, if it is available
at all. This precludes its being used for free software, since free
software writers disclose the source code of their programs. The
second reason is that when devices like these have had their embedded
processors removed, the operating system must perform the work of the
embedded processors, often at <emphasis>real-time</emphasis> priority,
and thus the CPU is not available to run your programs while it is
driving these devices. Since the typical Windows user does not
multi-process as intensively as a Linux user, the manufacturers hope
that the Windows user simply won't notice the burden this hardware
places on their CPU.  However, any multi-processing operating system,
even Windows 2000 or XP, suffers from degraded performance when
peripheral manufacturers skimp on the embedded processing power of
their hardware.

</para><para>

You can help this situation by encouraging these manufacturers to
release the documentation and other resources necessary for us to
program their hardware, but the best strategy is simply to avoid this
sort of hardware until it is listed as working in the 
<ulink url="&url-hardware-howto;">Linux Hardware Compatibility HOWTO</ulink>.

If you ask for Parity RAM in a computer store, you'll probably get

(but not always) be distinguished because they only have one more chip
than an equivalent non-parity SIMM, and that one extra chip is smaller
than all the others. Virtual-parity SIMMs work exactly like non-parity
memory.  They can't tell you when you have a single-bit RAM error the
way true-parity SIMMs do in a motherboard that implements
parity. Don't ever pay more for a virtual-parity SIMM than a
non-parity one. Do expect to pay a little more for true-parity SIMMs,
