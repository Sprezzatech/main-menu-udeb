Feel free to add/delete new/obsolete items as needed.

1. Yet to write:
================

en/module/

  Describe each installer module (this is why the book is written)

  Ability to install from PLIP?

en/tech-info/

  Information on how to customize your own boot floppy, what needs to
  be compiled into the kernel. Some info can be reused from the old
  manual and from the debian-installer/doc/docbook/kernel-policy.xml
  file.

rescue-replace-kernel

  Document how to make a replacement kernel for special needs.


2. Update and proofread:
========================

There are still various small left-overs all over the manual (like
mentioning various kernel flavors based on 2.2 kernels [hardware/*,
install-methods/downloading-files.xml, boot-installer/i386.xml].

We have to rename image names according to the new archive order.

Above is true especially for non-i386 architectures, volunteers needed!

en/partitioning/

  General facts should stay there, but *concrete* steps from
  installation should be moved into en/module/part*.xml.

en/partitioning/device-names.xml:

  Install system uses devfs, so device names are different

en/boot-installer/i386.xml

  Tell more how to boot for TFTP for the various systems.
  Mostly a pointer to further documentation of the system,
  but now the user knows where to look for.

2.1. Broken things

en/welcome/doc-organization.xml

  The &url-install-manual; link is broken and results in a bad sentence.
  
  Missing documentation on building d-i from source. There is a commented
  out sentence that linked to an old boot-floppy-techinfo document.

3. Create reasonable build system
=================================

Currently there is just whacky wow-i-can-get-html-out-of-it build
system in ./build directory.

3.1 build related items
-----------------------

Move doc/manual/validate.sh to the doc/manual/build directory.

Move doc/manual/doc-check to the doc/manual/build directory.

Aviod other scripts in the top doc/manual directory.
