 <title>Setting Up PPP</title>

<para>If your computer is not connected to a network, you will next be asked whether you wish to install the rest of the system using PPP. </para><para>If you do choose to configure PPP at this point, a program named <command>pppconfig</command> will be run. This program helps you configure your PPP connection. <emphasis>Make sure, when it asks you for the name of your dialup connection, that you name it <userinput>provider</userinput>.</emphasis> </para><para>Hopefully, the <command>pppconfig</command> program will walk you through a pain-free PPP connection setup. However, if it does not work for you, see below for detailed instructions. </para><para>In order to setup PPP, you'll need to know the basics of file viewing and editing in GNU/Linux. To view files, you should use <command>more</command>, and <command>zmore</command> for compressed files with a <userinput>.gz</userinput> extension. For example, to view <filename>README.debian.gz</filename>, type <userinput>zmore README.debian.gz</userinput>. The base system comes with an editor named <command>nano</command>, which is very simple to use, but does not have a lot of features. You will probably want to install more full-featured editors and viewers later, such as <command>jed</command>, <command>nvi</command>, <command>less</command>, and <command>emacs</command>. </para><para>Edit <filename>/etc/ppp/peers/provider</filename> and replace <userinput>/dev/modem</userinput> with <userinput>/dev/ttyS<replaceable>&num;</replaceable></userinput> where <replaceable>&num;</replaceable> stands for the number of your serial port. In Linux, serial ports are counted from 0; your first serial port <phrase arch="i386">(i.e., <userinput>COM1</userinput>)</phrase> is <filename>/dev/ttyS0</filename> under Linux. <phrase arch="powerpc;m68k">On Macintoshes with serial ports, the modem port is <filename>/dev/ttyS0</filename> and the printer port is <filename>/dev/ttyS1</filename>.</phrase> The next step is to edit <filename>/etc/chatscripts/provider</filename> and insert your provider's phone number, your user-name and password. Please do not delete the <quote>\q</quote> that precedes the password. It hides the password from appearing in your log files. </para><para>Many providers use PAP or CHAP for login sequence instead of text mode authentication. Others use both. If your provider requires PAP or CHAP, you'll need to follow a different procedure. Comment out everything below the dialing string (the one that starts with <quote>ATDT</quote>) in <filename>/etc/chatscripts/provider</filename>, modify <filename>/etc/ppp/peers/provider</filename> as described above, and add <userinput>user <replaceable>name</replaceable></userinput> where <replaceable>name</replaceable> stands for your user-name for the provider you are trying to connect to. Next, edit <filename>/etc/ppp/pap-secrets</filename> or <filename>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</filename> and enter your password there. </para><para>You will also need to edit <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> and add your provider's name server (DNS) IP addresses. The lines in <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename> are in the following format: <userinput>nameserver <replaceable>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</replaceable></userinput> where the <replaceable>x</replaceable>s stand for numbers in your IP address. Optionally, you could add the <userinput>usepeerdns</userinput> option to the <filename>/etc/ppp/peers/provider</filename> file, which will enable automatic choosing of appropriate DNS servers, using settings the remote host usually provides. </para><para>Unless your provider has a login sequence different from the majority of ISPs, you are done! Start the PPP connection by typing <command>pon</command> as root, and monitor the process using <command>plog</command> command. To disconnect, use <command>poff</command>, again, as root. </para><para>Read <filename>/usr/share/doc/ppp/README.Debian.gz</filename> file for more information on using PPP on Debian. </para><para>For static SLIP connections, you will need to add the <userinput>slattach</userinput> command (from the <classname>net-tools</classname> package) into <filename>/etc/init.d/network</filename>. Dynamic SLIP will require the <classname>gnudip</classname> package. </para>
