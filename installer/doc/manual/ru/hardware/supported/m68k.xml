<para>Complete information concerning supported M68000 based (<emphasis>&architecture;</emphasis>) systems can be found at the <ulink url="&url-m68k-faq;">Linux/m68k FAQ</ulink>. This section merely outlines the basics. </para><para>The &architecture; port of Linux runs on any 680x0 with a PMMU (Paged Memory Management Unit) and a FPU (floating-point unit). This includes the 68020 with an external 68851 PMMU, the 68030, and better, and excludes the ``EC'' line of 680x0 processors. See the <ulink url="&url-m68k-faq;">Linux/m68k FAQ</ulink> for complete details. </para><para>There are four major flavors of supported <emphasis>&architecture;</emphasis> flavors: Amiga, Atari, Macintosh and VME machines. Amiga and Atari were the first two systems to which Linux was ported; in keeping, they are also the two most well-supported Debian ports. The Macintosh line is supported incompletely, both by Debian and by the Linux kernel; see <ulink url="&url-m68k-mac;">Linux m68k for Macintosh</ulink> for project status and supported hardware. The BVM and Motorola single board VMEbus computers are the most recent addition to the list of machines supported by Debian. Ports to other &architecture; architectures, such as the Sun3 architecture and NeXT black box, are underway but not yet supported by Debian. </para>
