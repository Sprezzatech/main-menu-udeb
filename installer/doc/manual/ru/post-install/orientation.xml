><title
>Orienting Yourself to Debian</title>
<para
>Debian is a little different from other distributions. Even if you're familiar with Linux in other distributions, there are things you should know about Debian to help you to keep your system in a good, clean state. This chapter contains material to help you get oriented; it is not intended to be a tutorial for how to use Debian, but just a very brief glimpse of the system for the very rushed. </para>

>Debian Packaging System</title>
<para
>The most important concept to grasp is the Debian packaging system. In essence, large parts of your system should be considered under the control of the packaging system. These include: <itemizedlist
> <listitem
><para
> <filename
>/usr</filename
> (excluding <filename
>/usr/local</filename
>) </para
></listitem
> <listitem
><para
> <filename
>/var</filename
> (you could make <filename
>/var/local</filename
> and be safe in there) </para
></listitem
> <listitem
><para
> <filename
>/bin</filename
> </para
></listitem

><para
> <filename
>/sbin</filename

>/lib</filename
> </para
></listitem
> </itemizedlist
> For instance, if you replace <filename
>/usr/bin/perl</filename
>, that will work, but then if you upgrade your <classname
>perl</classname
> package, the file you put there will be replaced. Experts can get around this by putting packages on ``hold'' in <command
>aptitude</command
>. </para
><para
>One of the best installation methods is apt. You can use the command line version <command
>apt-get</command
> or full-screen text version <application
>aptitude</application
>. Note apt will also let you merge main, contrib, and non-free so you can have export-restricted packages as well as standard versions. </para>

>Application Version Management</title>
<para
>Alternative versions of applications are managed by update-alternatives. If you are maintaining multiple versions of your applications, read the update-alternatives man page. </para>

  <sect2
><title
>Cron Job Management</title>
<para
>Any jobs under the purview of the system administrator should be in <filename
>/etc</filename
>, since they are configuration files. If you have a root cron job for daily, weekly, or nightly runs, put them in <filename
>/etc/cron.{daily,weekly,monthly}</filename
>. These are invoked from <filename
>/etc/crontab</filename
>, and will run in alphabetic order, which serializes them. </para
><para
>On the other hand, if you have a cron job that (a) needs to run as a special user, or (b) needs to run at a special time or frequency, you can use either <filename
>/etc/crontab</filename
>, or, better yet, <filename
>/etc/cron.d/whatever</filename
>. These particular files also have an extra field that allows you to stipulate the user under which the cron job runs. </para
><para
>In either case, you just edit the files and cron will notice them automatically. There is no need to run a special command. For more information see cron(8), crontab(5), and <filename
>/usr/share/doc/cron/README.Debian</filename
>. </para>
