 <title>Vue générale du processus d'installation</title>
<para>

First, just a note about re-installations. With Debian, a
circumstance that will require a complete re-installation of your
system is very rare; perhaps mechanical failure of the hard disk would
be the most common case.

</para><para>

Many common operating systems may require a complete installation to
be performed when critical failures take place or for upgrades to new
OS versions. Even if a completely new installation isn't required,
often the programs you use must be re-installed to operate properly in
the new OS.

</para><para>

Under &debian;, it is much more likely that your OS can be repaired
rather than replaced if things go wrong. Upgrades never require a
wholesale installation; you can always upgrade in-place. And the
programs are almost always compatible with successive OS releases.  If
a new program version requires newer supporting software, the Debian
packaging system ensures that that all the necessary software is
automatically identified and installed. The point is, much effort has
been put into avoiding the need for re-installation, so think of it as
your very last option. The installer is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
designed to re-install over an existing system.

Here's a road map for the steps you will take during the installation
process.

If you have problems during the installation, it helps to know which
packages are involved in which steps. Introducing the leading software
actors in this installation drama:

</para><para>

The installer software, <classname>debian-installer</classname>, is
the primary concern of this manual. She directs the
architecture-specific partitioning program, installs the linux kernel,
and then supervises <classname>modconf</classname> to load specific
hardware drivers, <classname>dhclient</classname> to set up the
network connection, <classname>debootstrap</classname> to install the
base system packages, and &boot-loader-installer;, the boot loader
installer. Many more actors play smaller parts in this process, but
<classname>debian-installer</classname> has completed her task when
you load the new system for the first time.

</para><para>

Upon loading the new base system, <classname>base-config</classname>
supervises adding users, setting a time zone, and setting up the
package installation system. It then offers to launch
<classname>tasksel</classname> which will install large groups
of related programs, and in turn <classname>aptitude</classname> which
allows you to choose individual software packages.

</para><para>

</para><para>

When <classname>debian-installer</classname> finishes, before the
first system load, you have only a very basic command line driven
system. The graphical interface which displays windows on your monitor
will not be installed unless you select it during the final steps,
with either <classname>tasksel</classname> or
<classname>aptitude</classname>.  It's optional because many &debian;
systems are servers which don't really have any need for a graphical
user interface to do their job.

</para><para>

Just be aware that the X system is completely separate from
<classname>debian-installer</classname>, and in fact is much more
complicated. Installation and trouble shooting of the X windows
installation is not within the scope of this manual.
