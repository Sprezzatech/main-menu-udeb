Network booting an ia64 system requires two architecture-specific actions.
On the boot server, DHCP and TFTP must be configured to deliver elilo.  
On the client a new boot option must be defined in the EFI boot manager
to enable loading over a network.

  <sect3 arch="ia64" id="boot-tftp-server"><title>Configuring the Server</title>
<para>

A suitable TFTP entry for network booting an ia64 system looks something
like this:

<informalexample><screen>

host mcmuffin {
        hardware ethernet 00:30:6e:1e:0e:83;
        fixed-address 10.0.0.21;
        filename "elilo.efi";
}

</screen></informalexample>

Note that the goal is to get elilo.efi running on the client.

</para><para>

Create an ia64/ subdirectory in your tftpboot directory, and populate it with
the vmlinuz and initrd.gz files from the Debian installer netboot directory.

</para><para>

Copy elilo.efi to your tftpboot directory and make it world readable.  
This file can usually be found in the elilo package in IA64 distributions,
or in /usr/lib/elilo or in a subdirectory of /boot/efi.  A suitable copy is
provided in the Debian installer netboot directory.

</para><para>

Create an elilo.conf file in your tftpboot directory.  This will
be loaded by elilo.efi once it is running on the client, and controls what
happens next, including the choice of kernel, initrd image, etc.  An
example file is provided in the Debian installer netboot directory, review
the contents and update as needed for your choice of paths, etc.

It is possible to have different config files for different clients by naming
them using the client's IP address in hex with the suffix .conf instead of
elilo.conf.  See documentation provided in the elilo package for details.

  <sect3 arch="ia64" id="boot-tftp-client"><title>Configuring the Client</title>
<para>
To configure the client to support TFTP booting, start by booting to EFI and
entering the "Boot Option Maintenance Menu".  
</para><para>
Add a boot option.
</para><para>
Select the line saying "Load File [Acpi()/.../Mac()] and press enter.
</para><para>
Name the entry "Netboot" or something similar, save, and exit back to the
boot options menu.  
</para><para>
You should see the new boot option you just created, and
selecting it should initiate a DHCP query, leading to a TFTP load of elilo.efi
from the server.
