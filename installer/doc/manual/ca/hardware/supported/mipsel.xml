DECstation: various models of the DECstation are supported.

Cobalt Microserver: only MIPS based Cobalt machines are covered here.
This included the Cobalt Qube, RaQ, Qube2 and RaQ2, and the Gateway
Microserver.

Broadcom BCM91250A (SWARM): this is an ATX form factor evaluation board from
Broadcom based on their SiByte processor family.

Complete information regarding supported mips/mipsel machines can be found
at the <ulink url="&url-linux-mips;">Linux-MIPS homepage</ulink>.  In the
following, only the systems supported by the Debian installer will be
covered.  If you are looking for support for other subarchitectures, please
contact the <ulink url="&url-list-subscribe;">
debian-&architecture; mailing list</ulink>.

<para>

Currently only DECstations with R3000 and R4000/R4400 CPUs are
supported by the Debian installation system on little endian MIPS.
The Debian installation system works on the following machines:

All Cobalt machines are supported which have a serial console (which is
needed for the installation).

</para><para>

The Broadcom BCM91250A evaluation board comes with an SB1250 chip with two
SB-1 cores which are supported in SMP mode by this installer.

</para>

   <sect3><title>Supported console options</title>
<para>

Serial console is available on all supported DECstations (9600 bps,
8N1). For using serial console, you have to boot the installer image
with the "console=ttySx" kernel parameter (with "x" being the number
of the serial port you have your terminal connected to - usually "2",
but "0" for the Personal DECstations).  On 3MIN and 3MAX+ (DECstation
5000/1xx, 5000/240 and 5000/260) local console is available with the
PMAG-BA and the PMAGB-B graphics options.

</para><para>

If you have a Linux system to use as serial terminal, an easy way
is to run <command>cu</command><footnote>

<para>
In Woody this command was part of the <classname>uucp</classname> package,
but in later releases it is available as a separate package.
</para>

</footnote> on it. Example:

<informalexample><screen>
$ cu -l /dev/ttyS1 -s 9600
</screen></informalexample>

where the option "-l" (line) sets the serial port to use and "-s" (speed)
sets the speed for the connection (9600 bits per second).

</para><para>

Both Cobalt and Broadcom BCM91250A use 115200 bps.
