 <title>Preparing Files for USB Memory Stick Booting</title>

<para>

For preparing the USB stick you will need a system where GNU/Linux is
already running and where USB is supported. You should ensure that the
usb-storage kernel module is loaded (<userinput>modprobe
usb-storage</userinput>) and try to find out which SCSI device the USB
stick has been mapped to (in this example
<filename>/dev/sda</filename> is used). To write to your stick, you
will probably have to turn off its write protection switch.

</para><para>

Note, that the USB stick should be at least 128 MB in size (smaller
setups are possible if you follow <xref linkend="usb-copy-flexible"/>).

  <title>Copying the files - the easy way</title>
<para arch="i386">

There is an all-in-one file <filename>hd-media/boot.img.gz</filename>
which contains all the installer files (including the kernel) as well
as <command>SYSLINUX</command> and its configuration file. You only
have to extract it directly to your USB stick:

<informalexample><screen>
# zcat boot.img.gz &gt; /dev/<replaceable>sda</replaceable>
</screen></informalexample>

Of course this will destroy anything already on the device, so take
care that you use the correct device name for your USB stick.

There is an all-in-one file <filename>hd-media/boot.img.gz</filename>
which contains all the installer files (including the kernel) as well
as <command>yaboot</command> and its configuration file. Create a
partition of type "Apple_Bootstrap" on your USB stick using
<command>mac-fdisk</command>'s <userinput>C</userinput> command and
extract the image directly to that:

<informalexample><screen>
# zcat boot.img.gz &gt; /dev/<replaceable>sda2</replaceable>
</screen></informalexample>

After that, mount the USB memory stick (<userinput>mount
<replaceable arch="i386">/dev/sda</replaceable>
<replaceable arch="powerpc">/dev/sda2</replaceable>
/mnt</userinput>), which will now have
<phrase arch="i386">a FAT filesystem</phrase>
<phrase arch="powerpc">an HFS filesystem</phrase>
on it, and copy a Debian netinst or businesscard ISO image to it.
Please note that the file name must end in <filename>.iso</filename>.
Unmount the stick (<userinput>umount /mnt</userinput>) and you are done.

  <title>Copying the files - the flexible way</title>
<para>

If you like more flexibility or just want to know what's going on, you
should use the following method to put the files on your stick.

&usb-setup-i386.xml;
&usb-setup-powerpc.xml;

   <sect3>
   <title>Adding an ISO image</title>
<para>

Now you should put any Debian ISO image (businesscard, netinst or even
a full one) onto your stick (if it fits). The file name of such an
image must end in <filename>.iso</filename>.

</para><para>

If you want to install over the network, without using an ISO image,
you will of course skip the previous step. Moreover you will have to
use the initial ramdisk from the <filename>netboot</filename>
directory instead of the one from <filename>hd-media</filename>,
because <filename>hd-media/initrd.gz</filename> does not have network
support.

</para><para>

When you are done, unmount the USB memory stick (<userinput>umount
/mnt</userinput>) and activate its write protection switch.

   <title>Booting the USB stick</title>
<warning><para>

If your system refuses to boot from the memory stick, the stick may
contain an invalid master boot record (MBR). To fix this, use the
<command>install-mbr</command> command from the package
<classname>mbr</classname>:

<informalexample><screen>
# install-mbr /dev/<replaceable>sda</replaceable>
