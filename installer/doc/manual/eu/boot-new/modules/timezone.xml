 <title>Configuring Your Time Zone</title>

<para>

You will first be prompted to configure your time zone.
<phrase arch="m68k;powerpc">Macintosh hardware clocks are normally
set to local time. If you want to dual-boot, select local instead of
GMT.</phrase>
After selecting local vs. GMT hardware clock setting, you will select
a region and then a city within that region which is in the same time
zone you are. When making selections in these lists, you can type a
single letter to take you to the section of the list beginning with
that letter.
