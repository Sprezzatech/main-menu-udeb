msgid "The Debian Installer consists of a number of special-purpose components to perform each installation task. Each component performs its task, asking the user questions as necessary to do its job. The questions themselves are given priorities, and the priority of questions to be asked is set when the installer is started."

msgid "When a default installation is performed, only essential (high priority) questions will be asked. This results in a highly automated installation process with little user interaction. Components are automatically run in sequence; which components are run depends mainly on the installation method you use and on your hardware. The installer will use default values for questions that are not asked."
msgstr "Σε μια τυπική εγκατάσταση, μόνο οι απαραίτητες (υψηλής προτεραιότητας) ερωτήσεις θα ερωτηθούν. Αυτό θα έχει ως αποτέλεσμα την αυτοματοποίηση της διαδικασίας εγκατάστασης με μικρή συμμετοχή του χρήστη. Τα συστατικά εκτελούνται διαδοχικά και η σειρά εκτέλεσής τους καθορίζεται κυρίως από τη μέθοδο της εγκατάστασης που χρησιμοποιείτε και την αρχιτεκτονική σας.
