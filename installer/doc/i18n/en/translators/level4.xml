<para>
The level 4 of translations groups together the translations of
programs which may output messages to the screen but do not input users.
</para>

<para>All internationalized packages which output messages to the screen
during first and second stage are considered part of the level 4 of
&d-i; localization.
</para>

<para>This includes the following Debian packages:

	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		  debconf (program)
		</para>
	      </listitem>

<para>
<classname>dpkg</classname> and <classname>apt</classname> are very often used during the
whole life of a Debian system, so having them translated, though very
tedious, is a must-have for a good localized system.
</para>

<para>
<classname>discover1</classname> and <classname>debconf</classname>
outputs messages to the console during &d-i; processes.
</para>

debconf (program)

<title>
Package description
</title>

<para>
The <command>debconf</command> program is the software which is used
for user interaction during Debian packages configuration step. All
Debian packages should use <command>debconf</command> when they need
user input for installation-time configuration.
</para>

<para>
<command>debconf</command> may output information to the screen: this
is why the program translation is included in &d-i; fourth level of
translation.
</para>

<para>
<classname>Debconf</classname> also prompts users with questions when
installed. However, during a complete &d-i; run, these questions are
pre-answered with the similar questions from the
<classname>cdebconf</classname> package (which is part of level 1). As
a consequence, the translation of these questions is only part of level
5.

Files location and access methods
</title>

<para>
The package uses a <acronym>SVN</acronym> repository. Commit access may be requested to
the &i18n-coords;. However, as the translatable parts do not change
very often, getting commit access is not highly useful.
</para>

Package description
</title>

<para>
The <classname>dpkg</classname> program is a low level program which
installs and removes Debian packages.
</para>

<para>Including it in &d-i; level 4 of translation is an extension of
the scope of &d-i; localization process. <classname>dpkg</classname>
does not output very often during a base system install, but is very
likely to be used further, either directly invoked by the system
administrator or from another program such as
<classname>aptitude</classname>, <classname>apt</classname>, or <classname>dselect</classname>
(<classname>dselect</classname> translations are part of
<classname>dpkg</classname> translations).
</para>

<para><classname>dpkg</classname> full translation is a huge work
because there are hundreds of strings in the POT file. Most of these
strings are very short strings and most of them are hard-formatted
because they are used from a command-line program.

<para>
This package is a <quote>regular</quote> Debian package. The
package maintenance team uses arch repositories to maintain
it.

Updating/Adding translations
</title>

<para>
Translations should be reported as bugs against the
<classname>dpkg</classname> package.
</para>

<para>
The translation will be committed quickly by the dpkg localization
maintainer. This will not appear immediately on status pages because
<classname>dpkg</classname> development is handled in
<quote>arch</quote> repositories which are not easily handled by the
scripts which generate the status pages.

Specific recommendations

<para>
Undoubtfully, <classname>dpkg</classname> translation
requires a good knowledge of the Debian package management system as
well as some good experience of command-line programs translation.
</para>

<para>
The developers have put comments targeted at translators for some
strings. Translators should read and follow them carefully.
