<appendix id="branches"><title>Branches in &d-i; <acronym>SVN</acronym> repository</title>

<para>&d-i; is maintained in two separate branches:</para>

<itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
              <para>
	      The <emphasis>sarge</emphasis> branch includes all
	      packages included in the release of the installer
	      targeted at the sarge release of the Debian
	      distribution. This is the <emphasis>stable</emphasis>
	      branch of Debian installer with few modifications.
              </para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
              <para>
	      The <emphasis>trunk</emphasis> branch is the development
	      branch of D-I. This is the place where new features, or
	      bug fixes appear first. So, this is also the place where
	      new translations have to go and the place where new
	      strings are added or existing strings are changed.
              </para>
	    </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
From the translator point of view, all updates, <emphasis>even those
targeted at sarge</emphasis> have to be made in the trunk branch. The
synchronisation script run by the &i18n-coords; will do the job of
spreading the changes to the sarge branch. So, in short, most of the
time, translators will only change files in the trunk branch.
</para>

<para>
The only case where translators will have to commit changes to the
sarge branch is for strings which have disappeared from trunk and are
only in sarge. A list of those strings will be maintained by the 
&i18n-coords;.
</para>

<para>
From the developers point of view, the only important point to mention
is that changesets merged from trunk to sarge do not need to include
the content of debian/po directories as it will be updated anyway by
the synchronisation script.
</para>
