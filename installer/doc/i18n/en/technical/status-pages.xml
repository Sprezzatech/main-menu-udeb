<para>
The &d-i; team and the &i18n-coords; maintain web pages giving the
statistics of translations for each language, level by level. The
scripts that generate these statistics may be found in the
<filename>scripts/l10n/statistics</filename> directory of &d-i;
<acronym>SVN</acronym> repository.
</para>

<para>
Translators should check these pages regularly in order to follow the
possible changes to upstream packages and then update their work if
needed.
</para>

<para>The address for the top page of translation statistics is <ulink
url="&url-d-i-translation-status;">&url-d-i-translation-status;</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
The statistics page will give statistics about translations as close
as possible from the sources. If the package maintainer for a given
package uses a publicly accessible repository, the statistics are
generated from this repository.
</para>

<para>
The real status for each package (ie the status of translations for
the packages released in the Debian archive) can be found on the
Debian general l10n pages: <ulink
url="&url-debian-l10n;">&url-debian-l10n;</ulink>
