This is a list of available hooks available for debian-installer
modules and extentions.

/etc/rcS.d/S[0-9][0-9]* [rootskel]
    If this is an executable program, it is executed when d-i is
    booting, before the main menu is presented.

/cdrom/.disk/udeb_include [anna]
/cdrom/.disk/udeb_exclude
    List of packages (udebs) to install or not install in into the d-i
    ramdisk.

/etc/autopartkit.d/*.table [autopartkit]
    Partition table instructions for autopartkit. The selection is
    done using debconf.

/cdrom/.disk/base_include [base-installer]
/cdrom/.disk/base_exclude
    The content of these files are taken as lists of packages to
    install or not into the target area.

/usr/lib/base-installer.d/* [base-installer]
    The files in this directory are executed in sequence before
    debootstrap is called.

/usr/lib/prebaseconfig.d/* [prebaseconfig]
    The files in this directory are executed in sequence at the end of
    the installation.

/var/lib/partconf/fstab.d/* [partconf?]
    partconf and mkfstab read all files in this directory and append
    the lines (with or without modification) to the generated
    /target/etc/fstab.

/usr/share/partitioner/${ARCH}.sh [partitioner?]
/usr/share/partitioner/common.sh
    partitioner first try to call the shell script for the current
    architecture, and if this script doesn't exist it runs common.sh
    with the selection harddisk as argument. The script can then do
    whatever is needed to partition a harddisk on this arch (eg
    running fdisk (text) or cfdisk (slang)).

/var/lib/partconf/block.d/* [partconf?]
    partconf execute for each partition every script in this
    directory, so some udebs can place scripts here, and then block
    the output of some partitions; very useful for raid/lvm support.
    ( planned to included by Thorsten Sauter )

apt-install [rootskel]
    Program used in postinst scripts to ask for a package to be
    installed into the installed system.
