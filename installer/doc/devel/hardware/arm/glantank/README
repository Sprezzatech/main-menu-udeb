The GLAN Tank is a NAS device with a 400 MHz IOP chip, 2 IDE slots, 128 MB
RAM, 4 USB ports and 1 GBit Ethernet.  Other devices from IO-Data, in
particular the HDL-Gxxx, HDL-GWxxx, and HDL-GZxxx series, are very similar
and should be supported too.

The GLAN Tank only has 0.5 MB flash which contains a version of RedBoot
that can read a kernel and initrd from IDE disk.  It starts the following
commands:

RedBoot> load hda1:/initrd -r -v -b 0x00800000 -m disk
Can't load 'hda1:/initrd': Bad filename
RedBoot> load hda1:/zImage -r -v -b 0x00012000 -m disk
Can't load 'hda1:/zImage': Bad filename
RedBoot> exec -c "root=/dev/hda2 initrd=0xa0800000,8M rw console=ttyS0,115200 mem=128M@0xa0000000"

There are a number of implications for debian-intaller.  First of all,
given that there's no network support or similar in RedBoot, the initial
kernel and ramdisk to start d-i have to be put on an IDE manually as
"zImage" and "initrd" (on hda1).  Secondly, because of the cmd line, d-i
has to use an initramfs.  An initrd (ext2, cramfs) will not work because
while it will load the initrd it will then try to access root (/dev/hda2)
and fail.  d-i can only be started by using an initramfs.  Finally, it
also means that this machine needs a /boot partition on hda1 and / on
hda2.
