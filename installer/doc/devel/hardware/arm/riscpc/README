They have standard IDE but it's quite slow.  There are various IDE (and
SCSI) extensions card (much faster), but it's not clear which ones are
actually supported by the kernel these days.  In terms of CPU, there are
various plug-in cards, ranging from pretty slow ARM core to the decent
StrongARM.  The kernel (one binary) supports all of them.

RiscOS normally doesn't know about partitions so ideally you'd just install
Linux on a separate disk.  Since RiscOS doesn't know about partitions,
basically everyone made up their own.  Four different partition schemes are
commonly in use:

 - msdos partitions
 - acorn partitions
 - powertec (a company that makes scsi cards defined their partition scheme)
 - castle

RiscOS uses adfs as its filesystem.  Linux can read and write to it.

Linux is loaded via RiscOS.  RiscOS is stored in ROM, so from our POV we
can simply treat it as some kind of firmware.  There are two boot loaders:
 - !linux: works, but is not open source
 - linloader: doesn't work on many machines

In terms of configuring the boot loader, you'd have to look for the
!linux directory on the adfs partition and then edit the config file and
copy the kernel into that directory. (In RiscOS, all files which belong to
a program are put in one directory.)

In fact, there are multiple options to boot Linux:

 - !linux

 - !dRun:

     - edit !dRun/!Run

Misc:

14:56 < kyllikki> tbm: ok, riscstation is gone in 2.6 as are all 7500
 ARM710 and ARM610 cpus because their mmus are broken
14:56 < tbm> kyllikki: ah, ok
14:56 < tbm> kyllikki: I'll document that then
14:56 < kyllikki> tbm: if the RPC is strongarm thats fine and it should
 work out the box
14:56 < kyllikki> the bootloaders are a bit shitty
14:57 < kyllikki> tbm: note I said the 610 and 710 and 7500 specificaly
 arm7TDMI and later cores atill work fine
14:57 < kyllikki> tbm: yeah nuke pre 2.6.15 support on ARM
