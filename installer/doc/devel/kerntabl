Please do not assume this table is up-to-date unless you've just updated
it yourself. It is provided as a framework for tracking kernel updates.

This is used to track the kernel versions that we have udebs built for; the
udeb versions that are being used to build d-i images, the versions of the
kernel debs that are installed by base-installer, and the kernels that are
put on CDs. All of these have to be coordinated for a d-i release.

Note that this table is currently being used to track the status of the d-i
sarge branch as well as trunk, and values represent both unless otherwise
noted.
