Please do not assume this table is up-to-date unless you've just updated
it yourself. It is provided as a framework for tracking kernel updates.

This is used to track the kernel versions that we have udebs built for; the
udeb versions that are being used to build d-i images,Â any versions of the
kernel debs that are hardcoded into base-installer, and the kernels that are
put on CDs. All of these have to be coordinated for a d-i release.
