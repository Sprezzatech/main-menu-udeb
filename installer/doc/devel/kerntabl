Please do not assume this table is up-to-date unless you've just updated
it yourself. It is provided as a framework for tracking kernel updates.

This is used to track the kernel versions that we have udebs built for; the
udeb versions that are being used to build d-i images, the versions of the
kernel debs that are hardcoded into base-installer (as listed in
templates-arch), and the kernels that are put on CDs. All of these have to
be coordinated for a d-i release.

[1] arm CDs include the 2.6 kernel for footbridge and s3c2410
[2] m68k/mac 2.2 tracked by this line; 2.6 mac support is different
[3] kernel-image-* for r4k-ip22 r5k-ip22 sb1-swarm-bn; needs to be updated
    for 2.6 and didn't some of these subarches get renamed?
[4] kernel-image-* for r3k-kn02 r4k-kn04 cobalt lasat; needs to be updated
    for 2.6 and didn't some of these subarches get renamed?
[5] kernel-image-* for many powerpc subarches that probably don't need 2.4
    kernels anymore, including some d-i no longer supports
