To upload a package correctly, do the following:

* Ensure that your build environment is set up correctly to avoid .svn
  directories to be included in your uploads.
  The following settings in your configuration should do this:
  - ~/.bashrc:
    export DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE=CVS:.svn
  - ~/.devscripts:
    DEBUILD_DPKG_BUILDPACKAGE_OPTS="-i -I"
    DEBUILD_PRESERVE_ENVVARS=DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE

* Update from Subversion:
  svn up

* Check that you don't have any uncommitted changes or files that do not
  belong in the package:
  svn st

* Update the translator info in debian/changelog by copying and pasting
  the output (if any) of the following command:
  scripts/l10n/output-l10n-changes -d .
  Take care that you preserve the UTF-8 encoding of the changes!

* Change the distribution to unstable:
  dch -r

* Build:
  debuild

* Check the resulting package:
  debc, debdiff, etc.

* Commit and tag the release:
  debcommit --release
