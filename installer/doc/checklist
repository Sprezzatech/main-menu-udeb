Important fixes:

 - broken sparc64 module loading (fix: busybox-cvs 20040415-3)
 - broken support for 100 gb partitions on i386 (fix: base-installer 0.083)
 - the above problem seems to affect nearly any size partitions on alpha
   and probably other 64 bit systems workaround: base-installer 0.083)
 - messed up line drawing characters in base-config (fix: base-config 2.29)
 - broken ataraid and ida support (fix: libdebian-installer 0.26.really.0.22)

Less important fixes:

 - 2.6 lvm and raid segfaults and hangs (fix: lvm2 2.00.16-2)
 - airport module not available post-reboot on powerpc (fix: ddetect 0.101)
 - firewire cd support (fix: ddetect 0.101)
 - mips Installs on r4k-ip22 needs 36 mb ram (fix: unknown -- new glibc?)
