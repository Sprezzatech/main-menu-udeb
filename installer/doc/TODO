Things we really should fix before rc2:

	- finish 2.6.8 and 2.4.27 kernel upgrades, all applicable arches
	- fix syslinux parameter bug #269424
		(NMU in unstable, 2.11-0.1)
	- fix red screen problem

Things that would be nice for rc2, but can't block it:

	- pcmcia-cs resource range detection
		(untested patch from per)
	- X's failure to use read-edid at all (#264792)
	- vmelilo-installer needs to remove no_bootloader
	  from /target/etc/kernel-img.conf
	- whiptail breaks time zone selection for argintina, other bad bugs
		(fixed in whiptail 0.51.6-12)
	- gnome-cups-manager fix #271405 (ugly error on desktop install)
		(fixed in 0.22-2, not yet in testing)
	- support for root on raid


This TODO list can only touch on some larger issues, but there are a great
many open bugs on various components of the installer. See all bugs tagged
d-i in the BTS. Also, there are many unprocessed installation-reports bugs.


Status for different parts of debian-installer.  The numbers are
approximate (as in +/- 50%) and may change in any direction, at any
time.

[0%] Not begun
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- some architectures
		hurd-i386 (we will ship w/o this)
		sh (we will ship w/o this)

[30%] Might need large rewrites. Current implementation might
      work by accident
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        - GUI frontend to cdebconf.
		There are some basic implementations. The trick is to make
		it a GUI that does not suck, while still using debconf
		underneath.
	- ppp support
		  Not as important for analog dialup, as for ISDN, pppoe.

	
[60%] Needs some work, but does its grunt work
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- I18N
		Mostly done, still filling in minor holes.
	- translations
		Varying languages translated to varying degrees.
		http://people.debian.org/~seppy/d-i/translation-status.html
        - boot loader installers (lilo, grub, etc)
		Work, except for when they don't. See BTS.
	- anna
		Works, mostly.  Needs support for Release files.
		Support for signed Release files would be cool, but
		needs gpgv-udeb.
		Needs to have load-installer properly split out of the anna
		binary to save space on root floppy. Or removed, not used
		anymore.
        - disk selector, partitioner
		We have switched to partman everything except a couple of
		subarches and s390.
	- bugreporter-udeb
		only supports saving to floppy, which many lack
		should offer a way to save via network or to usb stick
	- post-reboot configuration
		base-config is stable, though it could use more polish
		i18n is needed.
		Some questions repeat questions from d-i.
	- web site
		http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/
		Could be better laid out, lacking some sections, other
		parts are quite good.
	- archive integration
		No automatic propagation to testing.
		No source propagation for udeb sources!
	- pcmcia support
		Much improved, generally works now.
		Automatic PCI resource range exclusion based on probing
		still needed, work in progress.
	- low memory support
		Where "low" is 32-46 mb!
		Works, but user must be careful to set up swap ASAP.
		There is no sanity checking, and some bad failure modes.
        - user documentation
		Installation manual is up-to-date for i386.
		Needs sanity checking for other architectures.
		Translations need updates.
	- developer documentation
		We understand it, but casual hackers have a high barrier to
		doing simple things like using a custom kernel.
	- 2.6 support
		Works on i386, with minor bugs.
		Works on powerpc, at least newworld. Testing on
		other subarches needed, especially G5 and oldworld (with
		mkvmlinuz).
	- preseeding
		Some things still cannot be preseeded. This is generally a
		bug in the udeb's use of debconf.
	- some architectures
		i386
		ia64
		powerpc
		mips
			SGI (mips/r4k-ip22 and mips/r5k-ip22)
				- fix parted's DVH disk labels support (#239371)
				- install dvhtool
			Broadcom SWARM (mips/sb1-swarm-bn)
				- Needs a working boot loader in the archive
			Documentation, manual
			XXX the above may be somewhat out of date
		mipsel
			DECstation (mipsel/r3k-kn02 and mipsel/r4k-kn04)
				- cannot boot from CD (see end of #241231)
			Cobalt (mipsel/cobalt)
				- figure out whether to set link_in_boot=yes
				  (see trunk/packages/rootskel/debian/templates-arch)
				- boot has to be ext2 -r 0
				- support installs via SSH, w/o serial console
				- boot: use: execute rd_start=0x{initrd-start} rd_size=0x{initrd-size} console=ttyS0,{console-speed}
				- debconf should output progess on the LCD
			Documentation, manual
			XXX the above may be somewhat out of date
		m68k (some subarches)
		alpha
		sparc
		arm (some subarches)
		hppa
		amd64 (unofficial)
		s/390
			lowmem issues
			On its first release, probably still some problems.

[90%] Single missing important feature or bug.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- hw-detect
		Working but needs to be switched over to discover2
	- iso-scan
		Works, but does not flag the disk the iso is mounted from
		as unusable by the rest of the installer.
        - netcfg
		Working, pending rewrite for IPv6.
	- bts
		Still need a non-manual way to tag our bugs.
	- language-chooser
		The perennial problem is how to order/present the list of
		languages. Many complaints, but it works.
        - base system installer
		It can break due to testing package churn. cdebootstrap
		would fix this; also debootstrap/apt/archive changes in
		progress to add Base: overrides to Packages files.

[100%] Those shouldn't need to be touched any more 
       (famous last words)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

	- floppy retriever
        - main-menu
        - choose-mirror
        - busybox integration

	- kernel-package integration

Common problems and transitions
===============================

This is a list of common mistakes that need to be corrected throughout the
code base:

  * All debconf commands that INPUT, GO, GET or SET questions should check
    their return value. This is pure evil:

    debconf->command(debconf, "GET", "mirror/suite", NULL); /* unchecked return code ! */
    asprintf(&command, "foo %s", debconf->value);
    system(command);

  * cdebconf's debconfclient.h has a set of macros for calling debconf
    (debconf_get() and so on)
    These should perhaps be used consistently throughout the code for
    clarity.

  * There needs to be a centralised logging method. Syslog will do, but
    we currently have a lot of nasty code that appends messages to
    /var/log/messages directly. All of that would be converted to pipe it
    to logger. However, this is a problem, because piping a command to
    logger loses the exit status of the command. Need some way to run a
    command, logging the ouput to syslog, w/o losing exit status.

  * udebs should not include md5sums files, or postrm, prerm, preinst
    scripts. This includes ones generated by debhelper. Linda will find
    these pretty well.

  * There is no need to set the seen flag anymore. All code that does so
    should be removed, unless that code is expected to also possibly run on
    a normal debian system (choose-mirror).
