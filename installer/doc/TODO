Status for different parts of debian-installer.  The numbers are
approximate (as in +/- 50%) and may change in any direction, at any
time.

[0%] Not begun
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- some architectures
		hurd-i386 (we will ship w/o this)
		sh (we will ship w/o this)

[30%] Might need large rewrites. Current implementation might
      work by accident
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        - GUI frontend to cdebconf.
		There are some basic implementations. The trick is to make
		it a GUI that does not suck, while still using debconf
		underneath.
	- ppp support
		  Not as important for analog dialup, as for ISDN, pppoe.
	- 2.6 support
		Works on powerpc with many local hacks. Needs fixes to
		busybox-cvs-udeb (in BTS) and modular ext2 support.
	- some architectures
		hppa
		amd64 (unofficial)
		s/390 (needs parted support or an alternative formatter/mounter)
		
[60%] Needs some work, but does its grunt work
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- I18N
		Mostly done, still filling in minor holes. Mostly
                BIDI support (Hebrew, Arabic...). Countrychooser
		short list translation (patch exists but increases
		the package size a lot)
	- translations
		Varying languages translated to varying degrees.
		http://people.debian.org/~seppy/d-i/translation-status.html
        - boot loader installers (lilo, grub, etc)
		Work, except for when they don't. See BTS.
	- anna
		Works, mostly.  Needs support for Release files.
		Support for signed Release files would be cool, but
		needs gpgv-udeb.
		Needs to have load-installer properly split out of the anna
		binary to save space on root floppy. Or removed, not used
		anymore.
        - disk selector, partitioner
		We have switched to partman for most arches, but not all.
		We do not have a usable partition mounter/formatter on
		s390.
	- wireless support
		Seems to generally work most of the time.
	- bugreporter-udeb
		only supports saving to floppy, which many lack
	- post-reboot configuration
		base-cofig is stable, though it could use more polish
		i18n is needed.
		Some questions repeat questions from d-i.
	- linda support for udebs, to catch all the common gotchas
		(lintian support in progress)
	- web site
		http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/
		Could be better laid out, lacking some sections, other
		parts are quite good.
	- archive integration
		No automatic propagation to testing.
		No source propigation for udeb sources!
	- pcmcia support
		- may work, may not.. (many failure reports)
		- cardbus is broken
		- Probably need to re-run hw-detect after loading pcmcia from
		  the net_driver floppy.
	- low memory support
		Where "low" is 32-46 mb!
		Works, but user must be careful to set up swap ASAP.
		There is no sanity checking, and some bad failure modes.
        - user documentation
		Short term we have the INSTALLATION-HOWTO, but the real
		install manual is still being polished.
	- developer documentation
		We understand it, but casual hackers have a high barrier to
		doing simple things like using a custom kernel.
	- 2.6 support
		  Works on i386, with minor bugs.
		  Many modules are not included in udebs yet.
	- some architectures
		i386
		ia64
		powerpc (some subarches)
		mips
		mipsel
		m68k (some subarches)
		alpha
		sparc
		arm (some subarches)

[90%] Single missing important feature or bug.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- hw-detect
		Working but needs to be switched over to discover2
	- iso-scan
		Works, but does not flag the disk the iso is mounted from
		as unusable by the rest of the installer.
        - netcfg
		Working, pending rewrite for IPv6.
	- bts
		Still need a non-manual way to tag our bugs.
	- language-chooser
		The perennial problem is how to order/present the list of
		languages. Many complaints, but it works.
        - base system installer
		It can break due to testing package churn. cdebootstrap
		would fix this; also debootstrap/apt/archive changes in
		progress to add Base: overrides to Packages files.
	- dhcp
		Needs to switch to busybox's internal one to save space.

[100%] Those shouldn't need to be touched any more 
       (famous last words)

Common problems and transitions
===============================

This is a list of common mistakes that need to be corrected throughout the
code base:

  * All debconf commands that INPUT, GO, GET or SET questions should check
    their return value. This is pure evil:

    debconf->command(debconf, "GET", "mirror/suite", NULL); /* unchecked return code ! */
    asprintf(&command, "foo %s", debconf->value);
    system(command);

  * Nothing should send error messages to stderr. If there is an error,
    use debconf to display a message. stderr messages will overwrite the
    newt frontend.

  * cdebconf's debconfclient.h has a set of macros for calling debconf
    (debconf_get() and so on)
    These should perhaps be used consistently throughout the code for
    clarity.

  * There needs to be a centralised logging method. Syslog will do, but
    we currently have a lot of nasty code that appends messages to
    /var/log/messages directly. All of that would be converted to pipe it
    to logger. However, this is a problem, because piping a command to
    logger loses the exit status of the command. Need some way to run a
    command, logging the ouput to syslog, w/o losing exit status.

  * udebs should not include md5sums files, or postrm, prerm, preinst
    scripts. This includes ones generated by debhelper. Linda will find
    these pretty well.

  * There is no need to set the seen flag anymore. All code that does so
    should be removed, unless that code is expected to also possibly run on
    a normal debian system (choose-mirror).
