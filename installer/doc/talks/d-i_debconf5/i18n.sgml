<title>Why localize?</title>

<para>
A recurrent debate often comes about the necessity to localize the
installation process of a Linux distribution. Indeed, a very commonly spread
idea floats where Unix/Linux systems adminstrators have to get some fluency
in the English language to do their work, so they should not really worry
about using this language to install a Linux system.

<para>
This very narrow point of view is fortunately quite outdated in the Debian
community and the need for localisation of the installer is well established
for years. However, the main arguments are still valid and reminding them
may be of some interest.

<para>
First of all, not every system administrator prefers using English. Most of
them, in real life, just pick up their own language when it is available.

<para>
Moreover, Debian is more and more newbie friendly. As explained elsewhere in
this paper, one of the design goals of the installer was making it easy to
use for every user, including newcomers to the Linux environments. Here,
offering a completely localised installation process becomes a key point.

<para>
Finally, more and more Custom Debian Distributions arebased on Debian sarge
and thus depend on Debian Installer for their installation process. Some of
these distributions are targeted at home users or for use in educational
environments, where a complete localisation is also a key argument of choice.

<title>Early design choices</title>

<para>The very modular nature of D-I has made localisation easier because it
became really easy for translators to focus on the most important issues.

<para>The key point has been putting all translatable strings into
debconf-style templates (sometimes by using specific templates introduced
with cdebconf, the C-rewritten debconf program). The advent, during early
sarge development, of the use of gettext for debconf templates i18n, made
the process very simple for translators.

<sect3>
<title>The advent of the d-i i18n team</title>
</sect3>

<para>During the early stages of Debian Installer, translators first were
the translators of boot-floppies, or were coming from established
translations teams. The work was then pretty informal with translators
joining themselves the D-I development mailing list and get accessto the CVS
repository to commit translations themselves.

<para>There was already a few dozens of D-I packages at these moments and
following the status of translations rapidly became nearly impossible to
translators.

<para>The first D-I beta versions also raised the problem of completing the
translation work for the releases with barely no infrastructure to follow
the completion and a need to have a gateway between developers and the
emerging "team" of translators. The need for some documentation for
internationalisation and localisation work of the installer was also a goot
motivation to get people specifically involved in i18n coordination.

<para>The first signs of early i18n coordination appeared in mid 2003 with
the first beta releases of D-I. Petter Reinholdtsen, because of the
Skolelinux needs in that matter, began acting that way and wrote the first
version of a specific documentation for D-I localisation.

<para>Beta 4 release finally made the i18n coordination team a reality,
bringing D-I developers a reliable way to include i18n and l10n in release
schedules.

<title>Generalities</title>
<sect3>
<title>Internationalisation with po-debconf</title>

<para>Each D-I package, just like other regular packages includes templates
translations in a "debian/po" directory in the package source tree. In that
directory, one file per language groups together all the templates strings
translations for that package

<para>The final package build process assembles these templates and their
translations together without any manual internvention from the package
maintainer or D-I developer.

<para>That very simple process is completely identical to processes involved
in regular Debian packages for debconf templates translations, which makes
the work simpler for both translators and developers.


</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>The concept of "levels"</title>

<para>The design choices of D-I make it strongly interact with "regular" D-I
packages. Indeed, as soon as possible in the installation process, D-I
leaves other packages control the installation process. Even in the "first
stage" (the installation step before the only reboot), a few parts of user
interaction are provided by regular Debian packages, through specific udeb
packages.

<para>After the reboot, the "second stage" of D-I is controlled by the
base-config package, which may still be seen as a D-I package (it is
maintained by the D-I team). However, this package heavily relies on other
packages such as shadow, tasksel, pppconfig and a few others to achieve some
tasks. This means that a full localisation of the installation process, as
seen from the user, has to include these packages localisation.

<para>In order to give translators priorities and make their work
progressive, the i18n team has established "levels" of translation which
group together all involved parts, sorted by order of "importance" with
regards to localisation.

<para>The technical section of this paper will describe details about these
levels.

</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Documentation i18n</title>

<para>Documenting the installation process has always been a priority in
Debian. The Installation Manual is indeed a long tradition of good quality
documentation to assist users and system administrators installing their new
Debian system.

<para>Because of the complete rewrite of the installation process, the
Installation Manual had to be completely rewritten, from scratch for many
parts. Here as well, getting some translation work is a huge improvment to
make Debian a real "universal operating system".

<para>The installation manual translations are handled separately from the
programs translations. Up to a very recent past, they even didn't use
gettext to handle translations but a system quite similar to the Debian web
site translation system.

<para>For obvious reasons, the work being way too much bigger, the
installation manual is currently translated in less languages than the
installer itself. This is also probably due to the use of a somewhat more
complex system not involving gettext.

<para>Plans for the future are a slow switch to gettext, which already
began for a few languages, while other teams have preferred staying with the former system as long as sarge is not released.

<title>Organisation</title>
<sect3>
<title>The coordination team</title>

<para>The role of the i18n coordination team is very wide. Indeed, it may be
shortened to "be the articulation point between D-I developers and D-I
translators". Even if translators have always been considered as full
members of the D-I team, the need for this articulation point was obvious.

<para>
The role of the i18n coordination team may be resumed in the following tasks:
	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		     It is the reference point for translators. Each translators
		     knows the (s)he can get every needed information from
		     one of the i18n team members.
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		     It guarantees a good consistency among English 
		     messages writing style. Though not strictly related to 
		     the l10n tasks, it rapidly appears that the i18n team is
		     most often the first aware of new needed templates and an
		     established practice is now, for developers, to get
		     a discussion about new templates writing style.
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		     New translators seeking and "validation". 
		     There are indeed two ways for new languages to get
		     included: self-nominated volunteers or contacts
		     established by one of the i18n team members. All these
		     new translators have to be accompanied during the early
		     stages of their work, up to the moment they can handle
		     it in complete autonomy. This process could be called
		     the "New Translator" process, even if not as formalized
		     as the New Maintainer process.
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		     The translators need tools to check whether their
		     translation work is still up-to-date. Translators are
		     never happy until they reached the heavens of 100%
		     completion. The role of the
		     D-I i18n team is to provide them these tools
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		      The i18n team members have to get a good knowledge of
		      D-I development to be able to assist translators as
		      well as handle i18n-related issues and bug reports.		
		      Some D-I packages are also partly maintained by the
		      i18n team such as languagechooser and countrychooser.
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		      In general, the i18n team coordinates all i18n-related activites
		      in the D-I team; It also manages the testing of the
		      release candidates with regards to i18n/l10n
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		      As translators are not always heavily aware of the
		      Debian development environment, the i18n team assists them
		      with Debian specific parts such as reporting
		      translations as bugs when they concern packages which
		      are not maintained by the D-I team.
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		      Bring new ideas and concept to make the translators
		      work easier. A translator should not have to focus on
		      complex systems such as revision control systems
		      or bug reporting. The translators time is better
		      invested doing translation work.
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		      Keep the contact with translators and put them to work
		      when releases are due
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		      Keep the contact with derived distributions when coordination is needed for l10n issues (Skolelinux, Ubuntu...)
	      <listitem>
		<para>
		      Finally, the i18n team is responsible for all issues
		      related to Debian installer Manual i18n
		      </itemizedlist>

<title>The translators</title>

<para>The translators and the translation teams are obviously the
people who do the real job. The basic principle in d-i i18n (and
indeed in whole Debian) is leaving translators and translation teams a
great freedom for their work method.

<para>This ends up in various situations, from languages where a
single individuals is the only responsible for the whole translation,
QA work, interaction with i18n coordination team up to languages where
a very structures team exists.

<para>The only requirement by the i18n coordination team is getting
the name and email address of a "reliable" contact which will be
further named the "language coordinator" for this language. A backup
coordinator is likely to have, though not required. And, finally, if
the translation is made with the support of a translation team
(internal or external to the Debian project), the name and address of
this team is needed (possibly with some write access to the team's
mailing list).

<para>Though the i18n coordination team assists translators in their
tasks and sometimes commits files in their name, autonomy is highly
wished with the language coordinator commiting him/herself
translations produced by the team and reporting bug reports for
packages not being part of the D-I team maintenance area.

</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>The developers</title>

<para>In the i18n process, the role of D-I developers is to ensure that all possibly translatable material is properly marked as translatable and use strings from the debconf i18n system for their packages. The "cdebconf" package documentation gives good examples of the use of debconf strings even outside the context of debconf.

<para>D-I developers also have to coordinate their work with the i18n coordination team when their work is likely to introduce new translatable strings. Such strings need peer review for the English messages style consistency checks.

<para>Developers of packages not maintained by the D-I team, but
needed by the installer (most of the time source packages producing
udeb paackages) must get in touch with the D-I i18n team when thei
package includes translatable material.

<title>Technical aspects</title>
<sect3>
<title>The levels</title>

<sect4>
<title>Level 1</title>

<para>The so-called level1 of translation in Debian includes all udeb
files which are part of the "first stage" of the installation process
and are maintained by the d-i team. This consists of the whole
debian-installer/ source tree on D-I development server.

<para>For simplicity reasons, the few packages which technically
belong to level 1 because some of their translatable material is used
during the first stage of the installation process have been moved to
"level 2" so that it may be clear that the level 1 is the "core" part
of D-I translations.

<para>At the moment of the writing of this paper, level 1 is made of
65 packages with l10n messages for a total of 1270 strings.

<para>To make the translators work easier to maintain, level 1 files
are gathered together in a single file put in packages/po in the D-I
development trees (sarge branch and development branch).

<para>This method of work does not allow split work but makes the
maintenance process far more easier as well as improves Quality
Assurance (because it guarantees that the same string is translated
the same way among packages).

<para>At the moment of this writing, only one team has not chosen to
switch to the "single file" system. This is still possible because
taken into account by the synchronisation script.

<para>The synchronisation script (l10n-sync) main job is spreading out
translations from the "master" file to the PO files in each
package. The internals of this script are detailed in D-I i18n
documentation. This script also combines all packages PO templates files (POT files) to a single POT file, which may be used by translators starting a new translation.

<para>Some languages may be defined as "prospective" languages, which
means that the translations for these languages are not spread out to
individual packages. The reason for this is the impact translations
have on the initial RAM disk size and the memory requirements of
D-I. Languages are removed from the "prospective" list only after the
D-I i18n coordination team has got the agreement of the D-I
development coordinator.

<para>Nine "prospective" language are waiting for the "gates opening"
as they were added after the language freeze of D-I occurred during
D-I RC2 development with the decision not to add more languages up to
the sarge release. These languages have been unmarked during D-I Debcamp during Debconf 5.

<para>With the languages, the total of languages supported in D-I is
50, including English. The number of languages supported in the sarge
branch is 41.

</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>Level 2</title>

<para>D-I translation "level 2" includes all packages *prompting*
users in default (high priority) base system installs.

<para>This includes two packages maintained by the D-I team
itself (base-config and tasksel) as well as regular packages
maintained by Debian developers outside the D-I team.

<para>Packages producing udebs used during the first stage of the
installation process have been added to this "level"

 -level 3: all packages *prompting* users in any kind of base system install
 -level 4: all packages displaying messages during a base system install
