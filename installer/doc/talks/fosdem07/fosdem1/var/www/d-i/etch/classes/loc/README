This directory is intended for fairly general localisation classes,
so the "loc/uk" class sets the keyboard, timezone etc for the UK.

I'm expecting to see classes like loc/de with german default settings,
but could imagine a need for loc/de-US for a machine with a US keyboard
that's running in germany.  Other than the uk one, I doubt I'll be using
any of these, so you'll have to tell me what's useful to the wider world.
