    - Set HOME=$(TEMP) while running hformat so that it doesn't require
      write access to the real $HOME/.hcwd, and clean up .hcwd afterwards.
    - Comment out miboot invocation for now; it's still not in the archive.

debian-installer (20040421) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Add a f3.txt.with26 to the cd_info tarball. It's the same as f3.txt,
      but with additional targets linux26 and expert26. This can be used
      as the f3.txt for CD images that include both kernels.
    - Turn off sparc floppy building, it does not autobuild because it needs
      root.
    - Add hfsutils [powerpc] to build deps.
  * Martin Michlmayr
    - Don't include ext3-modules in the netboot image on arm/netwinder,
      arm/riscpc and arm/ricstation since they are now (as of
      linux-kernel-di-arm (0.54)) built into the kernel.

  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Tell clean to remove tree-unpack stamp files.
  * Colin Watson
    - Sync hfs.map with debian-cd, adding .sit (see #186837).
    - Add parted-udeb to powerpc monolithic list.
  * Joey Hess
    - Access floppy is out of space, so drop all non-English text from
      it (any better ideas?).
    - For the monolithic target, include all kernel module udebs matching the
      kernel from localudebs, and also any non-kernel udebs, automatically, to
      make building custom kernels easier
    - Add a pkg-lists/kernel_specific, for 2.4 and 2.6, currently
      discover varies depending on the kernel major version, and there is a
      hack to use module-init-tools over busybox for 2.6.
    - Also add a kernel_specific isa-pnp-modules list, since 2.4 has the
      module and package, and 2.6 does not.
    - Add a new field to pkg-lists to get the kernel major version, and a
      KERNELMAJOR variable.
    - Add a monolithic_2.6 image type, a hd-media_2.6, and a netboot_2.6,
      none currently on by default, that use the 2.6 kernel. So far for i386
      only.
    - Also added 2.6 versions of the cdrom targets, though the el-torito
      one is out of space and disabled.
  * Martin Michlmayr
    - Add a netboot image for MIPS based Cobalt machines.
    - Use 2.4.25 kernels for mips and mipsel.
  * Joshua Kwan
    - Add all sorts of sparc/sparc64 floppy support, with a net-drivers
      disk for sparc64.
    - Add cdrom-core-modules dependency for cdrom/sparc.cfg, but only
      for sparc64. Hardcode it in because we don't support ${kernel:Version}
      in package names that aren't always available on one of the
      architectures being built for.
      (Closes: #242343, #239136, #239887, #240577)

      only since it's quite large and mostly useful for testing. Disabled
      for the moment until new kernel packages arrive in the archive.
    - Fix up powerpc CD image targets, which had bitrotted (a number of the
      variables they used weren't defined).
  * Martin Michlmayr
    - Clarify description of mips/sb1-swarm-bn's netboot images.
  * Bastian Blank
    - Split tree target.
    - Add generic and s390-tape type.

    - Add copyright info for the manual to debian/copyright.
    - Add logo by Alessandro Polverini and Andrea Mottola.
      Not the default until the Debian version is corrected though.
    - Add logo copyright info to debian/copyright.
    - Fix access floppy building with 2.6 kernel, same as root floppy was
      fixed earlier.
    - Out of space on the root floppy again. Split off a asian-root floppy.
    - Remove the pcmcia stuff from the cd-drivers floppy, it was too big.
    - Force the driver floppies to be of size FLOPPY_SIZE.
    - Add custom-kernel.txt
    - Add new image type, "monolithic", which build an initrd and a miniiso
      that contain all standard priority udebs, and does not need any other
      udebs to install Debian. This simple image type will be much easier to
      use for custom d-i builds, as you don't need to set up a CD or a mirror.
      It's also great for testing changes to $RANDOM_UDEB.
    - Add build-dep on grep-dctrl, used by monolithic image build process.
    - Add build-dep on bzip2 for powerpc, used by powerpc-builtin-initrd.sh to
      unpack the kernel tree.
    - Add build-dep on libparted1.6-0, needed during monolithic build
      due to versioned dependencies sillyness.

  * Joey Hess
    - Add udebs to support pcmcia cdroms to the pkg-lists for isolinux initrd,
      and to the cd-drivers floppy.
    - Add the kernel udeb to the root floppy pkg lists. It will be removed
      from the free dring build, but this will both give us an entry for the
      kernel in the status file, to prevent anna from doing bad things, and
      also will provide a System.map for depmod to run against, fixing
      builds on 2.6 kernels.
    - Removed the demo type.
    - Changed make demo and make shell to per-type targets.
    - Fixed the uml target similarly.
    - Added a qemu target, currently it can only handle booting floppies.
    - Remove broken and useless debian-installer-demo package.
      Closes: #218560

  * Colin Watson
    - Change comments in yaboot.conf files to say sarge, not woody.

      load-floppy now runs before it.
    - Reenable all translations for root floppy again, though this can't last.
    - Always include /dev/console, even for images that will use devfs.
      This means that netboot users will not have to remember the devfs=mount.
    - Left devfs=mount in syslinux.cfg anyway, out of general caution.
    - Add another dh_testroot call before udebs are downloaded.
    - Document debian-installer/probe/usb=false in syslinux f7.txt.
    - Docs are now included in the source package.
    - Remove the INSTALLATION-HOWTO copy hack.
    - Add docbook, docbook-xml, docbook-xsl, xsltproc to build deps.
    - Add the installation manual to the image tarballs.

    - Allow passing languages and arches to manual/build/build.sh in env
      variables.

      This caused the build to put modules.dep in the wrong directory, causing
      modprobe to fail - will need linux-kernel-di 0.50 to build.

    - Add input-modules to ia64 netboot and cdrom lists. Needed for USB

    - Add missing usb-discover to ia64 cdrom.
    - Add a kernel to the demo image type, because this is necessary to get
      the System.map so depmod will work on 2.6. The kernel is currently
      included in the demo image; I suppose you could use it somehow, and I
      didn't want to risk breaking builds by removing it.
    - Add alpha and s390 to the arch list, in case someone want to try to get
      them working for the release.

    - before running mklibs, copy all the libs from lib and usr/lib in the
      initrd to a temporary directory, and add that to mklib's search path
      with -L. This will make it avoid copying in large versions of libs from
      the build system if there is already a small version available in the
      initrd.
    - removed the slow, buggy code that added unneccessary and often wrong
      "-reduced" entries to the status file
  * Sylvain Ferriol
    - Add plip-modules to the net_drivers floppy.

    - Use -di flavored kernels for alpha
    - build-depend on aboot for alpha (needed for making
      floppies/CDs bootable)
    - include srm-modules and socket-modules in the alpha initrd
    - tell d-i that alpha CDROMs don't use a floppy image, just an
      initrd and kernel
    - upgrade to 2.4.24 for alpha kernels
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Remove dead apt-get code in the Makefile.
    - Redesigned build system. Major changes to the configuration
      handling for all architectures. Closes: #215508
    - Remove arhcdetect from m68k config, it is already in the generic
      config.
    - Fix broken alpha build, input-modules isn't created for -di
      kernel flavour.
    - Adjust daily-build script for the new build system.
    - Remove special handling for "default", it was broken anyway.
    - Switch back sparc kernel handling in tftpboot.sh to the old value.
    - Add support for MANIFEST files. Closes: #231767
    - Fix genromfs invocation, found by Thomas Poindessous.
  * Thomas Poindessous
    - Remove redundant kbd-chooser from netboot pkg-list.
    - Add discover, discover-data to sparc netboot image. Closes: #227853
    - Correct netboot image building on sparc. Closes: #228519
  * Joey Hess
    - Copyright date updates.
    - Add wireless-tools to the net_drivers floppy and the netboot initrd.
    - Switch the kernel to 2.4.24 for i386.
    - Document vga=771 option for laptops with display problems.
      Closes: #229904
    - Add syslinux splash image by Matthew A. Nicholson, and another by
      Klowner, and still another by Volkan YAZICI.
    - Make all the syslinux help screens leave graphics mode when displayed.
    - Hack syslinux.txt so it all fits on one line, the same line as the boot:
      prompt.
    - Add ${BOOTPROMPT} expansion to bootscreen-subst, to make it easy 
      to make the last line in a syslinux screen not have a newline at EOF
      on the image, while still being easily editable.
    - Switch cdroms from load-installer to load-cdrom. This is to work around
      limitations in main-menu (see #218774). Driver floppy loading will now
      be started by cdrom-detect if it fails to find a CD.
    - Version the mtools build-dep. Closes: #225584
    - Let HOST, BASEDIR, or DIR be set in the environment before running
      daily-build, to override the defaults.
    - Fix up miniiso creation to fit into the new build system better.
    - Turn on miniiso creation for netboot, so there is a
      dest/netboot/mini.iso that behaves the same as a netboot would.
    - Add a dest/cdrom/debian-cd_info.tar.gz with the syslinux screens
      and splash image, for eventual use by debian-cd.
    - Convert the miniiso to use isolinux, to support any size initrd.
    - Improvements to manifest generation and formatting.

    - ia64: Fix cdrom to autoboot, and tidy up kernel params.  Partial
      fix for 227114.
    - ia64: Change to 2.4.22 -di kernel, and include usb storage modules,
      and ide/scsi core modules.  Partial fix for 227114.
    - Increase ia64 'floppy' image to 10MB, and initrd to 24MB
    - hppa: Add config/type/netboot-hppa, so TYPE=netboot generates a lifimage
    - hppa: include fdisk-udeb in pkglists so we can partition.
    - hppa: include text frontend, as it is useful for debugging.
    - hppa: fix up palo cmdline for netboot lifimage

    - Generate bootable hd-media images, not just the initrd.
      These can be written directly the usb memory stick, then mounted
      and a d-i iso copied in. As they're quite big (and sparse),
      they are gzipped.
    - NB: The above change means you need 128+ mb more free space to
      build this package on i386.
    - If System.map is included in the kernel image udeb, pass it to depmod
      via -F and delete it when done. This is to support building on systems
      running 2.6.
    - Remove ide modules stuff from net drivers floppy. I don't know why it
      was there, but its deps were not met and this could cause ugly messages 
      during install.
    - Remove the same ide modules from i386 netboot.
    - Document the bootkbd boot parameter in syslinux f7.txt.
    - Add "expert" mode boot to syslinux, which sets DEBCONF_PRIORITY=low.
    - Include a doc/index.en.html in the install-images tarball, so
      debian-cd will find some documentation and not include the boot floppies
      docs.
    - Include INSTALLATION-HOWTO there too, by way of a gross, gross hack.
    - netcfg reorg
    - scsi-common-modules reorg
    - Grep out several encodings that confuse reduce-font:
      ISO-8859-*, EUC-JP, CP1251. This is a temporary hackaround to get it
      building again.
    - Access floppy filled up, so move the network stuff to the access_drivers
      floppy. That filled up access_drivers, so comment out SCSI support at
      least for now.
    - Turn ia64 back on, let's see if it builds now.
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Build the demo tree only for architectures which support it.
    - Don't build images for the demo target.
    - Ensure TYPE=demo for the Makefile's demo target.
    - Remove stamp files for tree and get_udebs at the begin of their rule,
      create them at the rule's end.
    - Ignore errors for the all_clean target.
    - Don't use USERDEVFS for linux-mips.
    - Fix 'make clean' if type demo is unsupported.
  * Marco d'Itri
    - Add preliminary support for .ko kernel modules.

debian-installer (20031212) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Switch i386 to using dhcp-client rather than pump for netboot.
      Left it using pump on other arches that did not already use dhcp-client,
      at least for now.
    - Switch i386, hppa, and ia64 to dhcp-client rather than udhcp
      on the root floppy.
    - Switch powerpc to pump on the root floppy.
    - Switch i386 to dhcp-client rather than udhcp on the access floppy.
    - Switch from pump to dhcp-client on powerpc.
    - Add disk labels to the i386 floppy images, for use by the bootfloppy
      initrd, and maybe later by the floppy retreiver, etc.
    - In debian/rules, if the changelog is unreleased, use unstable as the
      DISTRIBUTION.
    - makelabel takes the build date as its second parameter. Calculating
      BUILD_DATE once at the start to avoid inconsistencies during
      long/midnight builds.
    - Add MEDIA_TYPE to configs for bootable image types.
    - Add DEBIAN_VERSION to config.
    - Add bootscreen-subst to substitute these variables into boot screens.
    - Make a syslinux help screen, for all i386 syslinuxed boot media.
      Includes the build date, debian version, and media type, and is derived
      from isolinux help texts on the sarge cds, but modified to actually
      match d-i:
        - remove boot flavor docs, as we currently have no flavors
        - remove rescue stuff, as d-i is not currently also a rescue disk
        - reduce number of colors used for cleaner look
        - remove mention of non-free
        - try to make the prerequisites documentation somewhere close to
          reality -- 64 mb ram and 256 mb disk.
        - make every boot message screen 22 lines long, followed by a blank
          line (which is in turn followed by the boot: prompt), for consistent
          display
        - remove references in f4.txt to a nonexistant table
        - remove documentation of mono and vga16:off, as they do not work with
          d-i
        - remove keytimer hack documentation, that was for boot-floppies
        - add documentation of d-i's boot time parameters, including the new
          debian-installer/framebuffer=false
        - remove the mailing list subscription info; boot time is not the
          time to tell the user about this. In its place, make f9.txt be
          about Debian.
      - Remove DEBCONF_DEBUG setting from syslinux.cfg.
      - Use bootscreen-subst on powerpc's boot.msg, too.
      - Comment out the udeb apt status file stuff in get-packages, now is not
        the time to be breaking the build with that.
      - Build depend on elilo on ia64. This had better be the last one.
  * Goswin von Brederlow
    - Moved fetching of (u)debs into get-packages shell script.
    - Changed sources.list to sources.list.udeb, added sources.list.deb.
    - Allowed "deb file:/..." urls in /etc/apt/sources.list, (Closes: #221031)
      simplified sed expression and change file to copy urls.
    - Add explaining error message when apt-get update fails
    - get-packages: Only seed dpkg status with libs when getting udebs
    - pkg-lists/cdrom/alpha: missing input-modules-${kernel:Version}
    - pkg-lists/mirror_udeb: lists for a partial mirror suitable for the CDs
    - Drop pump-udeb (netboot on alpha, s390 and sparc) in favour of
      dhcp-client-udeb
    - debain/control: added Build-Depends: mkisofs
    - daily-build: changed to copy last days images and rsync new ones
    - daily-build: don't let the builder wait for logs, use tee
    - No discover for mips/mipsel
    - Added arch mips to the debian-installer.deb (Closes: #221534)
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Fix error handling in tftpboot.sh
  * Chris Tillman
    - Add DEBCONF_PRIORITY note to powerpc boot message.
    - Add MacRISC3 & 4 to ofboot.b for compatibility with G4/G5 powerpcs
  * Mario Lang
    - Add new boot floppy flavour "speakup" which uses a speakup-enabled
      kernel version.
    - Update the access flavour to use the same kernel version as the
      speakup flavour.
    - Update the access_drivers common and i386 pkg-list.
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Sanitize tftpboot.sh. It aborts now on errors and won't move/copy
      files around without good reason. Changed mipsel image generation
      to t-rex.
    - Add pkg-lists/netboot/mips.
    - Add fdisk to the mips/mipsel CD images, add AT keyboard support
      to mips image.
    - Add AT keyboard support to mips demo image.
    - Polish make/arch/linux-mips{,el} a bit.
    - Switch config/arch/linux-mips to kernel 2.4.22 with -di flavour.
