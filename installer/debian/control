# This package has the worst Build-Depends in Debian, so it deserves some
# explanation. Note that this comment can also be used to generate a
# Build-Depends line, by running the debian/genbuilddeps program.
# So put each build dep on its own line, prefixed by " - " and to
# comment out a build dep, start the line with two hashes. And don't edit
# the Build-Depends line above by hand.
#
# Base build dependencies:
#	- debhelper (>= 7.0.0)
#		Of course.
# 	- apt
# 		Used for downloading udebs.
# 	- apt-utils
# 		apt-ftparchive is used for including localudebs.
#	- gnupg
#		New versions of apt need gnupg for security checks.
#	- debian-archive-keyring (>= 2006.11.22)
#		To provide the archive key for security checks.
#	- dctrl-tools
#		Various manipulations of the udeb Packages files.
#	- wget
#		Used to test validity of mirrors.
#	- bc
#		Used for some image size calculations.
#	- debiandoc-sgml
#		partman's manual is in debiandoc.
#	- xsltproc
#	- docbook-xml
#	- docbook-xsl
#		The d-i internals manual is in DocBook XML.
#	- libbogl-dev [!kfreebsd-i386 !kfreebsd-amd64 !hurd-i386]
#		For bdftobogl used in font reduction.
#	
# Library build dependencies:
#	- glibc-pic
#		For library reduction.
#	- libslang2-pic (>= 2.0.6-4)
#		Make dependency versioned temporarily to make sure we avoid #392942
#	- libnewt-pic (>= 0.52.2-11.3) [!mipsel]
#		Rather than use slang and newt udebs, reduced versions of
#		the libraries are put onto images to save space.
#	- libnewt-dev (>= 0.52.2-11.3) [mipsel]
#		On mipsel, we can't use libnewt-pic right now due to bug
#		#329733. See also Build-Conflicts above.
#	- libgcc1 [i386 amd64]
#		On x86 we need to include /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 in g-i initrds to
#		work around #373253 until upstream can remove pthread_cancel()
#		On i386 
#		calls in directfb. For now, this is done by setting EXTRAFILES.
#
# Filesystem tools:
#	- cramfsprogs [powerpc ia64 mips mipsel armeb armel]
#		For arches that use cramfs initrds.
#	- genext2fs (>= 1.3-7.1)
#		For creating ext2 filesystems without being root.
#		1.3-7.1 fixes issues on several arches.
#	- e2fsprogs
#		genext2fs doesn't produce perfect filesystems, so we fsck
#		them.
#		Lintian: Yes, we know it's essential. We prefer not to
#		count on it remaining so.
#	- mklibs (>= 0.1.25)
#		We use mklibs for library reduction.
#	- genisoimage [!s390 !s390x]
#		For making mini isos.
#	- genromfs [sparc sparc64]
#		Used for creating sparc floppies (which are not built by
#		default.)
#	- hfsutils [powerpc]
#		For making bootable HFS USB sticks for powerpc.
#	- dosfstools [i386 ia64 m68k amd64]
#		For creating FAT filesystems with mkfs.msdos.
#		Of course i386/amd64 use this for floppies, CDs etc.
#		ia64 uses it for floppies (?)
#		m68k uses it for atari floppies
#	- cpio
#		For creating initramfs images.
#	- devio [armeb armel]
#		Tool to read and write from block devices, used to byteswap
#		kernels and add nslu2 boot magic.
#	- slugimage (>= 0.10+r58-6) [armeb armel]
#		For building nslu2 firmware images.
#	- dns323-firmware-tools [armel]
#		For building firmware images for the D-Link DNS-323.
#	- uboot-mkimage [armel]
#		For creating u-boot images
#
# Boot loaders:
#	On many arches boot loaders are copied onto or ran on the boot
#	images in one way or another. There's a reason our mailing list is
#	still called debian-boot..
#	- syslinux (>= 2:3.63+dfsg-2) [i386 amd64]
#		With menu default64 support.		
#	- palo [hppa]
#	- elilo [ia64]
#	- yaboot [powerpc]
#		For all our powerpc boot needs. Well, not really.
#	- aboot (>= 0.9b-2) [alpha]
#		A previous version didn't have netabootwrap.
#	- silo [sparc]
#		Using silo is problimatic since it needs to run as root,
#		so images that need it are not built by default, but we
#		include it for completeness.
#	- sparc-utils [sparc sparc64]
#		For elftoaout and piggyback, to make netboot images.
#	- genisovh [mips]
#		Makes mini iso images bootable on SGI MIPSen.
#	- tip22 [mips]
#		Piggyback netboot images.
#	- colo [mipsel]
#		For booting Cobalt machines.
#	- sibyl [mips mipsel]
# 		For booting the SWARM board.
#	- atari-bootstrap [m68k]
#		Booting and other tools for Atari systems.
#	- vmelilo [m68k]
#	- m68k-vme-tftplilo [m68k]
#		For VME machines, although it doesn't yet support running
#		as non-root, the install will try to use it and fall back
#		to a warning when it fails.
#	- amiboot [m68k]
#		Bootloader for m68k/amiga machines.
#	- emile [m68k]
#	- emile-bootblocks [m68k]
#		Bootloader for m68k/mac machines.
#	- apex-nslu2 [armeb armel]
#		2nd stage bootloader for Linksys NSLU2.
# Architecture specific build dependencies:
#	- tofrodos [i386 amd64 kfreebsd-i386 kfreebsd-amd64]
#		For todos, used on files that need to be accessible from
#		DOS.
#	- mtools [i386 ia64 m68k amd64 kfreebsd-i386 kfreebsd-amd64 hurd-i386]
#		mcopy is used to put files onto FAT filesystems w/o
#		mounting them.
#
#	- module-init-tools [i386 armeb armel amd64 alpha hppa ia64 m68k mips mipsel powerpc s390 sh4 sparc sparc64]
#		depmod for 2.6 kernels on the arches that support 2.6.
#
#	- bf-utf-source [!s390 !s390x]
#		Contains the unicode font we use. Not a udeb since we
#		perform font reduction at build time.
#	- mkvmlinuz [powerpc]
#		Used to make powerpc images that can boot direct from
#		firmware w/o using a boot loader.
#	- openssl [armel]
#		Used to encrypt a firmware image so an ARM based device
#		(Thecus N2100) will accept it.
#	- win32-loader [i386 amd64 kfreebsd-i386 kfreebsd-amd64 hurd-i386]
#		Alternative boot method for win32 platforms.
#	- makefs [kfreebsd-i386 kfreebsd-amd64]
#		Used to create an UFS1 filesystem from a directory tree.
#	- grub-pc (>= 1.98~20100101-1) [kfreebsd-i386 kfreebsd-amd64 hurd-i386]
#		Used as the CD-ROM's bootloader
#       - xorriso [kfreebsd-i386 kfreebsd-amd64 hurd-i386]
#               Used by grub-pc to create the CD-ROM images
#	- debian-ports-archive-keyring [sh4 sparc64]
#		Used for architectures hosted on debian-ports.org
