Debian lenny has two different and incompatible ARM ports: the old ABI
port (arm) and the EABI port (armel).  The images provided here are for
the old arm port.  The armel port is recommended for new installations
since the old arm port will be dropped after lenny.

port: http://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort
