# These library packages are excluded from dependency checking because
# they are currently provided not in udeb form but, by the library
# reduction step.

# libc gets reduced, so using the udeb is not a good idea
libc6 -
libc6-udeb -
# slang is also reduced
libslang2-udeb -
# and newt
libnewt0.51 -

# These are all candidates for using udebs.
# Alternitively, they could probably be reduced, if -pic libraries
# were made.
libtextwrap1 -

# These should just use udebs.
libdiscover1 -
libdebian-installer4 -
libdebconfclient0 -
