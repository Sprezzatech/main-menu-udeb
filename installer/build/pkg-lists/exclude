# These library packages are excluded from dependency checking because
# they are currently provided not in udeb form but, by the library
# reduction step.

# libc gets reduced, so using the udeb is not a good idea
libc6 -
libc6-udeb -
# slang is also reduced
libslang2-udeb -
# and newt
libnewt0.51 -

# This should really be a udeb.
