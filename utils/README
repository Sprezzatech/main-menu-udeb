These are simple utils for debian-installer:

di-utils-shell: interactive shell. Appears in the main menu, and the
postinst does all the work. Only funny trick is we need to steal control
from debconf by grabbing back the original stdio file descriptors.

pipe_progress: copies stdin to stdout. Each second, if there has been any
activity on the pipe, outputs a dot to stderr. This is used for a progress
display when the boot floppy is loading the second floppy.
