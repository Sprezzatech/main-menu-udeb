_Description: Interactive shell.
 After this message, you will be running "ash", a Bourne-shell clone. The
 root filesystem is a RAM disc. The hard disc file systems are mounted on
 "/target". The editor available to you is nano. It's very small and easy to
 figure out. To get an idea of what Unix utilities are available to you, run 
 "ls /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin". Use the "exit" command to return to the
 installation menu.
