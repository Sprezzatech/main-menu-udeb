Description: Interactive shell.
 You are running "ash", a Bourne-shell clone. The root filesystem is a
 RAM disk. The hard disk filesystems are mounted on "/target".
 The editor available to you is nano. It's very small
 and easy to figure out. To get an idea of what Unix 
 utilities are available to you, run "ls /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin".
 Use the "exit" command to return to the installation menu.
