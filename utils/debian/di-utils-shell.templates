_Description: Interactive shell.
 You are running "dash", a Bourne-shell clone. The root filesystem is a RAM
 disc. The hard disc filesystems are mounted on "/target". The editor
 available to you is nano. It's very small and easy to figure out. To get
 an idea of what Unix utilities are available to you, run "ls /bin /sbin
 /usr/bin /usr/sbin". Use the "exit" command to return to the installation
 menu.
