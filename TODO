* Fix all memory leaks (probably just the btree and the actual package
  structs).
* If I pick install lilo from the menu (and the dpkg runs fail), I'm seeing
  a new menu with doubled entries. If I don't call order_done, this doesn't
  happen.
* Freeing the tree doesn't work too well. Not everything is freed. If I
  just walk the tree I see more than if I put in the tdelete() calls.
  Fixing this may well fix the item above.
* Figure out how to handle configuring only one virtual package (pick off
  of a menu?) if the menu item depends on a virtual package.
