     - The main menu design has some issues. If a step is failing
       because some step above it did something wrong, but thought
       it succeeded (a disk was partitioned, but very badly, and
       installing the base system to it fails), there is no way to
       force the user to back up. This seems to preclude linear
       install mode. I posted a longer example to -boot. Three
       possible fixes:
                        - Detect loops, and have code to figure out what went
                          wrong and back up to the appropriate step that can
                          fix it
                        - Detect loops, and back up to the beginning of
                          the menu
                        - Detect whenever any menu item fails, and leave
                          linear mode. (BEST)

* Behaves rather badly if there is exactly one menu item (debconf
  auto-picks it), which is failing. :-)
