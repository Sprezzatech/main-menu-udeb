di-netboot-assistant (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * PXELinux tftp filenames handling changed:
   - DHCP configuration should be changed: PXELinux option 210 (pathprefix)
     isn't needed anymore. Previously, one had to configure the DHCP to send 
     option 210="/". This isn't required anymore (and it is deprecated).
   - PXELinux configuration file should be modified: All tftp filenames in
     pxelinux.HEAD should be prefixed with "::/" so PXELinux treats them as
     absolute location, this also applies to "append initrd=::/pathto/initrd".
     Then run "di-netboot-assistant rebuild-menu".
