* Does not support translating menu items. Two possibilities:
  - Use Description-<LL> even though dpkg doesn't know how to handle it.
  - Read in a detached file with menu description and menu ordering info in
    it. This may be more flexable anyway.. (It would also allow a single
    package to show 2 menu items.)
