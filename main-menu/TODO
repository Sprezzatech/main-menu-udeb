* Handle processing debconf's return codes and getting the textual return
  value.
* Once something is picked from the menu, (re)configure its package (and
  first configure everything its package depends on).
* Figure out how to handle configuring only one virtual package (pick off
  of a menu?) if the menu item depends on a virtual package.
* Does not support translating menu items. Two possibilities:
  - Use Description-<LL> even though dpkg doesn't know how to handle it.
  - Read in a detached file with menu description and menu ordering info in
    it. This may be more flexable anyway.. (It would also allow a single
    package to show 2 menu items.)
