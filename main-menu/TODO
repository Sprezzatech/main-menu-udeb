* Fix all memory leaks (probably just the btree and the actual package
  structs).
* Picking a main menu item that is unpacked but not configured doesn't seem
  to be running dpkg.
* Figure out how to handle configuring only one virtual package (pick off
  of a menu?) if the menu item depends on a virtual package.
* Does not support translating menu items. Two possibilities:
  - Use Description-<LL> even though dpkg doesn't know how to handle it.
  - Read in a detached file with menu description and menu ordering info in
    it. This may be more flexable anyway.. (It would also allow a single
    package to show 2 menu items.)
