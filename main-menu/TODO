     - The main menu design has some issues. If a step is failing
       because some step above it did something wrong, but thought
       it succeeded (a disk was partitioned, but very badly, and
       installing the base system to it fails), there is no way to
       force the user to back up. This seems to preclude linear
       install mode. I posted a longer example to -boot. Three
       possible fixes:
                        - Detect loops, and have code to figure out what went
                          wrong and back up to the appropriate step that can
                          fix it
                        - Detect loops, and back up to the beginning of
                          the menu
                        - Detect whenever any menu item fails, and leave
                          linear mode. (BEST)

* If package A depends on a virtual package B which is provided by C and D,
  and at least one of C and D is a menu item, the user is asked for which of
  C and D to use, but what if none of them is a menu item?
  For example:
  anna depends on retriever. Say you have the cdrom retriever and a floppy
  retriever installed, and you want to use the floppy retriever to load some
  modules for your arcane whizbang CD reader. How on earth would main-menu
  know that only the floppy retriever needs to be configured? If it asks, it
  overrides anna's retriever choice question (bad), if it doesn't ask, it has
  to either configure all providers, or select one arbitrarily. Ick.
