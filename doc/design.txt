Here is an overview of the new design.

1. initial boot off of install media (floppy, cd)
  - Syslinux (or other loader) is run, and it boots the kernel
2. kernel boot
  - The kernel sets up an initrd, runs the installer.
3. installer
  - Check to see what UI's are available (already unpacked onto the
    initrd), and chooses one of them.
  - Starts up and configures the UI.
  - Configures enough so that some udebs can be retrieved.
3.5 Main installer
  - Main menu runs (see ui.txt).
4. reboot into a full debian system
  - Since the system was installed with a minimal kernel that cannot talk to
    the hard drive, an initrd must be used. The initrd has a syslinux file on
    it, and a set of modules. It just loads the modules, in a certain order,
    with certain parameters, and then lets the kernel pass control to init.
  - Set up all packages that need to be set up (timezone, password, etc, etc).
