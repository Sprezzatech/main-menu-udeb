This is a list of all the boot parameters for the installer. These
environment variables are typically set on the boot loader command line.
For example:
  boot: linux DEBCONF_PRIORITY=low BOOT_DEBUG=1

DEBCONF_PRIORITY

	Control how many questions the installer asks. Default is high, use
	medium or low for more control, critical to make as far decisions
	as possible.

DEBCONF_FRONTEND

	Pick the frontend to use. Default is newt. Other frontends are not
	available on default install media, so this is not very useful.

BOOT_DEBUG

	Use this if the installer is not booting up properly, to get a more
	verbose boot process. It's set to a number:
		0 = not much, the default
		1 = more verbose
		2 = lots of debugging information
		3 = shells are run at various points in the boot
		    exit the shell to continue the boot
	Not supported by all boot methods currently.

INSTALL_MEDIA_DEV

	The value of the parameter is the path to the device to load
	the Debian installer from. For example,
	INSTALL_MEDIA_DEV=/dev/floppy/0
	
	The boot floppy, which normally scans all floppys and USB storage
	devices it can to find the root floppy, can be overridden by this
	parameter to only look at the one device.

	This parameter also controls which floppy drive driver floppys are
	read from.
