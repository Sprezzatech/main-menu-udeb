A new Debian installer for the New Year

The debian-installer team is pleased to announce the second beta release of
the Debian sarge installer. Supporting the i386, powerpc, mips, and ia64
architectures, the new installer features complete translations in over 16
languages, an improved and streamlined installation process, and many bug
fixes.

Maybe you were lucky and received a USB keychain or wrist watch in your
Christmas stocking this year. If so now's a great time to take advantage of
debian-installer's full USB support, and install Debian to your new
toy. Or, set it up as debian-installer boot media, so you can keep on
giving by installing Debian on anything that can boot from USB.

Maybe you were even luckier this year and have a new computer;
debian-installer will make it easy to install a modern Debian desktop from
CDROM, netboot, USB, or even floppys. If you got an ugly sweater for
Christmas instead, you're still in luck, because debian-installer now
supports comuters with only 32 MB of ram, so you can still give it a try on
the presents of Christmas past.

All we ask in return is a report of your experiences using the installer,
so we can strive to make it even better.
