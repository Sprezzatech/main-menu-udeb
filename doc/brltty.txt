Braille display support for d-i:
--------------------------------

Currently, only the cdrom (2.88MB) i386 includes brltty by default.
For a experimental netinst floppy with brltty, see
http://people.debian.org/~mlang/net-brl-1440.img.

To activate Braille display support during the installation,
you need to pass a boot parameter to the boot loader.  Here is the format:

brltty=driver-code,device,text-table

driver-code: A two-letter code which identifies the display model being in use.
  See brltty documentation for a complete list.
device: The device where the display is connected at.  If tts/0, this
  field can be left blank since that is the default.

text-table: The braille translation table to be used.  Default is the
 us table.  Examples might be de, fr, it, ru ...

Example:

For a PowerBraille display on tts/1 with a german braille translation table:
brltty=ts,tts/1,de

For a HandyTech display on tts/0 with us translation table:
brltty=ht
