Feel free to add/delete new/obsolete items as needed.

1. Yet to write:
================

en/module/

  Describe each installer module (this is why the book is written)

  Ability to install from PLIP?

  What about the LVM stuff (it shows up in d-i menu from time to
  time)?

en/tech-info/

  Information on how to customize your own boot floppy, what needs to
  be compiled into the kernel. Some info can be reused from the old
  manual and from the debian-installer/doc/docbook/kernel-policy.xml
  file.

en/install-methods/automatic-install.xml

  Write something more that just plain "We can do FAI".

en/appendix/files.xml

  In part entitled TBD we need to list more files like it was done in
  the old manual (if they are needed).

en/hardware/
en/install-methods/
en/boot-installer/

  If booting/installing from USB [stick] (or any other new method)
  will be supported in the official installer, then we should describe
  it here.

2. Update and proofread:
========================

There are still various small left-overs all over the manual (like
mentioning various kernel flavors based on 2.2 kernels [hardware/*,
install-methods/downloading-files.xml, boot-installer/i386.xml]. (Do
we have i386 flavors at all?)).

We should also shift from the old cruft (like mentioning floppies at
the _first_ place, or describe various techniques relative to MS-DOS).


en/hardware/network-cards.xml

  Comment states that this list of unsupported cards was completed
  against kernel-image_2.0.36-2. Ain't that a bit old?

en/install-methods/floppy/i386.xml

  Do we still have the possibility to create localized rescue floppy?

en/partitioning/

  General facts should stay there, but *concrete* steps from
  installation should be moved into en/module/part*.xml. Also update
  to d-i way of doing things is needed -- something about partman?
  ("Initialize a linux partition", "Initialize swap" and "Mount
  a Previously-Initialized Partition" are now done in one step...).

en/partitioning/device-names.xml:

  Install system uses devfs, so device names are different

en/boot-new/

  Some of this (the bootloader part (up to "The Moment of Truth"?))
  should really go into en/module/${arch}/*-installer.xml.
  (Besides, do we have 'Make a Boot Floppy' step)?

en/welcome/doc-organization.xml

  The partitioning chapter doesn't fit anywhere. Any suggestions?

en/boot-installer/i386.xml

  Tell more how to boot for TFTP for the various systems.
  Mostly a pointer to further documentation of the system,
  but now the user knows where to look for.


3. Create reasonable build system
=================================

Currently there is just whacky wow-i-can-get-html-out-of-it build
system in ./build directory.

3.1 build related items
-----------------------

Move doc/manual/validate.sh to the doc/manual/build directory.

Move doc/manual/doc-check to the doc/manual/build directory.

Aviod other scripts in the top doc/manual directory.

Fix the non-fatal build errors:
 Error: no ID for constraint linkend: boot-floppy-techinfo.
 Error: no ID for constraint linkend: rescue-replace-kernel.
 Error: no ID for constraint linkend: rescue-replace-kernel.
 Error: no ID for constraint linkend: kernel-images.
 Error: no ID for constraint linkend: driver-images.
 Error: no ID for constraint linkend: rescue-replace-kernel.
 Error: no ID for constraint linkend: init-config.
 Error: no ID for constraint linkend: rescue-replace-kernel.
 Error: no ID for constraint linkend: boot-from-floppies.
 Error: no ID for constraint linkend: rescue-replace-kernel.
