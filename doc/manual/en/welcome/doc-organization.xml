 <title>Organization of This Document</title>

<para>

This document is meant to serve as a manual for first-time Debian
users.  It tries to make as few assumptions as possible about your
level of expertise.  However, we do assume that you have a general
understanding of how the hardware in your computer works.

</para><para>

Expert users may also find interesting reference information in this
document, including minimum installation sizes, details about the
hardware supported by the Debian installation system, and so on.  We
encourage expert users to jump around in the document.

In general, this manual is arranged in a linear fashion, walking you
through the installation process from start to finish.  Here are the
steps in installing &debian;, and the sections of this document which
correlate with each step:

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>

Determine whether your hardware meets the requirements for using the
installation system, in <xref linkend="hardware-req"/>.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Backup your system, perform any necessary planning and hardware
configuration prior to installing Debian, in <xref linkend="preparing"/>. If
you are preparing a multi-boot system, you may need to create
partition-able space on your hard disk for Debian to use.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

In <xref linkend="install-methods"/>, you will obtain the necessary
installation files for your method of installation.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

<xref linkend="rescue-boot"/> describes booting into the
installation system.  This chapter also discusses troubleshooting
procedures in case you have problems with this step.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Setting up the Linux partitions for your Debian system is explained in
<xref linkend="partitioning"/>.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Install the kernel and configure peripheral driver modules in 
<xref linkend="install-system"/>. Configure your network connection 
so that remaining installation files can be obtained directly from a
Debian server, if you are not installing from a CD.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Initiate automatic download/install/setup of a minimal working
system in <xref linkend="install-base"/>.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Boot into your newly installed base system and run through some
additional configuration tasks, from <xref linkend="boot-new"/>.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Install additional software in <xref linkend="install-packages"/>. 
Use <command>tasksel</command> to install groups of packages which form a 
computer `task', <command>dselect</command> to select individual packages 
from a long list, or <command>apt-get</command> to install individual 
packages when you already know the package names you want.

</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

Once you've got your system installed, you can read 
<xref linkend="post-install"/>.  That chapter explains where to
look to find more information about Unix and Debian, and how to
replace your kernel.  If you want to build your own install system
from source, be sure to read <xref linkend="boot-floppy-techinfo"/>.

Finally, information about this document and how to contribute to it
may be found in <xref linkend="administrivia"/>.
