 <title>What is GNU/Linux?</title>

<para>The GNU Project has developed a comprehensive set of free software
tools for use with Unix&trade; and Unix-like operating systems such as
Linux.  These tools enable users to perform tasks ranging from the
mundane (such as copying or removing files from the system) to the
arcane (such as writing and compiling programs or doing sophisticated
editing in a variety of document formats).
</para>

<para>An operating system consists of various fundamental programs which are
needed by your computer so that it can communicate and receive
instructions from users; read and write data to hard disks, tapes, and
printers; control the use of memory; and run other software. The most
important part of an operating system is the kernel.  In a GNU/Linux
system, Linux is the kernel component.  The rest of the system
consists of other programs, many of which were written by or for the
GNU Project.  Because the Linux kernel alone does not form a working
operating system, we prefer to use the term ``GNU/Linux'' to refer to
systems that many people casually refer to as ``Linux''.

<para>The 
<ulink url="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux kernel</ulink> first appeared in
1991, when a Finnish computing science student named Linus Torvalds
announced an early version of a replacement kernel for Minix to the
Usenet newsgroup <userinput>comp.os.minix</userinput>.  See Linux International's

<para>Linus Torvalds continues to coordinate the work of several hundred
developers with the help of a few trusty deputies.  An excellent
weekly summary of discussions on the <userinput>linux-kernel</userinput> mailing
list is
