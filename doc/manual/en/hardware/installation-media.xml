In many cases, you'll have to do your first boot from floppy disks,
using the rescue floppy.  Generally, all you will need is a
high-density (1440 kilobytes) 3.5 inch floppy drive.

k) are also provided. ]]>

CD-ROM based installation is supported for some architectures.
On machines which support bootable CD-ROMs, you should be able to do a

installation.  Even if your system doesn't
support booting from a CD-ROM, you can use the CD-ROM in conjunction
with the other techniques to install your system, once you've booted
up by other means; see <xref linkend="install-cd"></xref>.

Both SCSI and IDE/ATAPI CD-ROMs are supported.  In
addition, all non-standard CD interfaces supported by Linux are
supported by the boot disks (such as Mitsumi and Matsushita drives).
However, these models might require special boot parameters or other
massaging to get them to work, and booting off these non-standard
interfaces is unlikely.  The 
<ulink url="&url-cd-howto;">Linux CD-ROM HOWTO</ulink>
contains in-depth information on using CD-ROMs with
Linux.

<para>
On DECstations, booting from CD-ROM requires a SCSI CD-ROM
drive capable of working with a logical blocksize of 512 bytes. Many
of the SCSI CD-DROM drives sold for the PC market do not have this
capability. If your CD-ROM drive has a jumper labeled "Unix/PC" or
"512/2048", place it in the "Unix" or "512" position.

CD 1 contains the installer for the r3k-kn02 subarchitecture
(the R3000-based DECstations 5000/1xx and 5000/240 as well as
the R3000-based Personal DECstation models), CD 2 the
installer for the r4k-kn04 subarchitecture (the R4x00-based
DECstations 5000/150 and 5000/260 as well as the Personal DECstation
5000/50).
</para>

<para>
To boot from CD, issue the command <userinput>boot <replaceable>#</replaceable>/rz<replaceable>id</replaceable></userinput>
on the firmware prompt, where <replaceable>#</replaceable> is the number of the TurboChannel
device from which to boot (3 on most DECstations) and <replaceable>id</replaceable>
is the SCSI ID of the CD-ROM drive.
If you need to pass additional parameters, they can optionally be appended
with the following syntax:

Installation system booting from a hard disk is another option for
many architectures.

<![ %m68k; [ In fact, installation from your local disk is the preferred
installation technique for most &architecture; machines. ]]>

<![ %sparc; [ Although the &arch-title; does not allow booting from SunOS 
(Solaris), you can install from a SunOS partiton (UFS slices).]]>

over the network.

<![ %supports-nfsroot; [
Diskless installation, using network booting
from a local area network and NFS-mounting of all local filesystems,
is another option &mdash; you'll probably need at least 16MB of RAM for a
diskless installation.

After the operating system kernel is installed, you can install the
rest of your system via any sort of network connection (including
PPP after installation of the base system), via FTP, HTTP, or NFS.

<para>The Debian boot disks contain a kernel which is built to maximize the
number of systems it runs on.  Unfortunately, this makes for a larger
kernel, which includes many drivers that won't be used for your
machine (see <xref linkend="kernel-baking"></xref> to learn how to build your own
kernel).  Support for the widest possible range of devices is
desirable in general, to ensure that Debian can be installed on the
widest array of hardware.
</para>

<![ %i386; [
<para>
Generally, the Debian installation system includes support for
floppies, IDE drives, IDE floppies, parallel port IDE devices, SCSI
controllers and drives.  The file systems supported include MINIX,
FAT, Win-32 FAT extensions (VFAT), among others (note that NTFS is not
supported by the installation system; you can add it later, as
described in <xref linkend="kernel-baking"></xref>).
</para>

<para>
The disk interfaces that emulate the ``AT'' hard disk interface which
are often called MFM, RLL, IDE, or ATA are supported.  Very old 8 bit
hard disk controllers used in the IBM XT computer are supported only
as a module. SCSI disk controllers from many different manufacturers
are supported. See the 
<ulink url="&url-hardware-howto;">Linux Hardware Compatibility HOWTO</ulink> 
for more details.
</para>

<para>
Not supported are IDE SCSI drives and some SCSI controllers, including

Pretty much all storage systems supported by the Linux kernel are
supported by the Debian installation system.  Note that the current
Linux kernel does not support floppies on the Macintosh at all, and
the Debian installation system doesn't support floppies for Amigas.
Also supported on the Atari is the Macintosh HFS system, and AFFS as a
module.  Macs support the Atari (FAT) file system.  Amigas support the
FAT file system, and HFS as a module.
