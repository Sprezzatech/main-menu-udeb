 <title>Memory and Disk Space Requirements</title>

<para>

You must have at least 16MB of memory and 110MB of hard disk
space. For a minimal console-based system (all standard packages),
250MB is required. If you want to install a reasonable amount of
software, including the X Window System, and some development programs
and libraries, you'll need at least 400MB. For a more or less complete
installation, you'll need around 800MB.  To install
<emphasis>everything</emphasis> available in Debian, you'll probably
need around 2 GB.  Actually, installing everything doesn't even make
sense, since some packages conflict with others.

On the Amiga the size of FastRAM is relevant towards the total memory
requirements.  Also, using Zorro cards with 16-bit RAM is not
supported; you'll need 32-bit RAM.  The <command>amiboot</command>
program can be used to disable 16-bit RAM; see the 
<ulink url="&url-m68k-faq;">Linux/m68k FAQ</ulink>.  Recent kernels should
disable 16-bit RAM automatically.

On the Atari, both ST-RAM and Fast RAM (TT-RAM) are used by Linux.
Many users have reported problems running the kernel itself in Fast
RAM, so the Atari bootstrap will place the kernel in ST-RAM. The
minimum requirement for ST-RAM is 2 MB.

On the Macintosh, care should be taken on machines with RAM-based
video (RBV). The RAM segment at physical address 0 is used as screen
memory, making the default load position for the kernel unavailable.
The alternate RAM segment used for kernel and RAMdisk must be at least
4 MB.
