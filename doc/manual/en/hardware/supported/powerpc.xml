There are four major supported <emphasis>&architecture;</emphasis>
flavors: PMac (Power-Macintosh) PReP, Apus, and CHRP machines.  Ports
to other <emphasis>&architecture;</emphasis> architectures, such as
the Be-Box and MBX architecture, are underway but not yet supported by
Debian. We may have a 64bit port (Power3) in the future.

Apple (and briefly a few other manufacturers - Power Computing, for
example) makes a series of Macintosh computers based on the PowerPC
processor. For purposes of architecture support, they are categorized
as NuBus, OldWorld PCI, and NewWorld.

</para><para>

Macintosh computers using the 680x0 series of processors are not in
the PowerPC family but are instead m68k machines. Those models start 
with `Mac II' or have a 3-digit model number such as Centris 650
or Quadra 950. Apple's pre-iMac PowerPC model numbers have four digits.

</para><para>

NuBus systems are not currently supported by debian/powerpc. The
monolithic Linux/PPC kernel architecture does not have support for
these machines; instead, one must use the MkLinux Mach microkernel,
which Debian does not yet support. These include the following:

OldWorld systems are most Power Macintoshes with a floppy drive and a
PCI bus. Most 603, 603e, 604, and 604e based Power Macintoshes are
OldWorld machines. The beige colored G3 systems are also OldWorld.

</para><para>

The so called NewWorld PowerMacs are any PowerMacs in translucent
colored plastic cases. That includes all iMacs, iBooks, G4 systems,
blue colored G3 systems, and most PowerBooks manufactured in and after
1999. The NewWorld PowerMacs are also known for using the `ROM in RAM'
system for MacOS, and were manufactured from mid-1998 onwards.

</para><para>

Recently introduced Macintosh systems have hardware which is more well
supported by the 2.4 Linux kernel. For some, the 2.2 kernel just
doesn't work. The new-powermac flavor, which uses the 2.4 kernel, has
been added to keep up with the hardware. The new-powermac flavor may
also be installed on other OldWorld and NewWorld machines. Machines
for which new-powermac is highly recommended are flagged with an
asterisk below.
