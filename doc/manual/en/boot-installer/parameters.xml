 <sect1 id="boot-parms"><title>Boot Parameters</title>
<para>

Boot parameters are Linux kernel parameters which are generally used
to make sure that peripherals are dealt with properly.  For the most
part, the kernel can auto-detect information about your peripherals.
However, in some cases you'll have to help the kernel a bit.

</para><para>

If this is the first time you're booting the system, try the default
boot parameters (i.e., don't try setting arguments) and see if it works
correctly. It probably will.  If not, you can reboot later and look for
any special parameters that inform the system about your hardware.

</para><para>

Full information on boot parameters can be found in the <ulink
url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/BootPrompt-HOWTO.html"> Linux
BootPrompt HOWTO</ulink>, including tips for obscure hardware.  This
section contains only a sketch of the most salient parameters.  Some
common gotchas are included below in 
<xref linkend="boot-troubleshooting"></xref>.

</para><para>

When the kernel boots, a message 

<informalexample><screen>

Memory:<replaceable>avail</replaceable>k/<replaceable>total</replaceable>k available 

</screen></informalexample>

should be emitted early in the process.
<replaceable>total</replaceable> should match the total amount of RAM,
in kilobytes.  If this doesn't match the actual amount of RAM you have
installed, you need to use the
<userinput>mem=<replaceable>ram</replaceable></userinput> parameter,
where <replaceable>ram</replaceable> is set to the amount of memory,
suffixed with ``k'' for kilobytes, or ``m'' for megabytes.  For
example, both <userinput>mem=65536k</userinput> and
<userinput>mem=64m</userinput> mean 64MB of RAM.

</para><para>

If your monitor is only capable of black-and-white, use the
<userinput>mono</userinput> boot argument.  Otherwise, your
installation will use color, which is the default.

</para><para condition="supports-serial-console">

If you are booting with a serial console, generally the kernel will
autodetect this 
<phrase arch="mipsel">(although not on DECstations)</phrase>
If you have a videocard (framebuffer) and a keyboard also attached to
the computer which you wish to boot via serial console, you may have
to pass the
<userinput>console=<replaceable>device</replaceable></userinput>
argument to the kernel, where <replaceable>device</replaceable> is
your serial device, which is usually something like ``ttyS0''.

</para><para arch="sparc">"

for &arch-title; the serial devices are ``ttya'' or ``ttyb''.
Alternatively, set the <replaceable>input-device</replaceable> and
<replaceable>output-device</replaceable> OpenPROM variables to
``ttya''.

  <sect2 id="installer-args"><title>Debian Installer Arguments</title>
<para>

The installation system recognizes a few boot arguments which may be
useful. 

</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>DEBCONF_PRIORITY=CRITICAL</term>
<listitem><para>

This will cause the installation system to
display only critical messages and try to do the right thing without
fuss.  If problems are encountered, the installer adjusts the priority
as needed.

</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>DEBCONF_PRIORITY=HIGH</term>
<term>DEBCONF_PRIORITY=MEDIUM</term>
<term>DEBCONF_PRIORITY=LOW</term>

<listitem><para>

These parameter settings will similarly set the highest priority of
messages to be displayed. For example, with the priority set to HIGH,
both high and critical priority messages are shown, but medium and 
low priority messages are skipped.

</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term>debug</term>
<listitem><para>

Emit additional debug messages to the installation system log (see
<xref linkend="dbootstrap-shell-log"></xref>), including every command run.

Some architectures use the kernel framebuffer to offer installation in
a number of languages. If framebuffer causes a problem on your system
you can use this option to disable the feature. Problem symptoms are
error messages about bterm or bogl, a blank screen, or a freeze within
a few minutes after starting the install.

</para><para arch="i386">

The video=vga16:off argument may also be used to disable
the framebuffer. Such problems have been reported on a Dell Inspiron with
Mobile Radeon card.

</para><para arch="m68k">

Such problems have been reported on the Amiga 1200 and SE/30.

</para><para arch="hppa">

Such problems have been reported on hppa.
