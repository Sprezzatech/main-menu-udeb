  <sect2 arch="sparc" id="install-nfs"><title>Booting from NFS</title>
<para>

To install the system via NFS, simply select
<userinput>NFS</userinput> for the location of the images and files
and follow the instructions provided.  You will be prompted for the
<filename>server:/directory</filename> where the images are located.

  <sect2 arch="sparc" id="install-tftp"><title>Booting with TFTP</title>
<para>

On machines with OpenBoot, simply enter the boot monitor on the
machine which is being installed (see 
<xref id="invoking-openboot"></xref>).
Use the command <userinput>boot net</userinput> to boot from a TFTP
and RARP server, or <userinput>boot net:dhcp</userinput> to boot from
a TFTP and DHCP server. Some older OpenBoot revisions require using
the device name, such as <userinput>boot le()</userinput>; these
probably don't support DHCP.

&intro-cd.xml;

<para>

Most OpenBoot versions support the <userinput>boot cdrom</userinput>
command which is simply an alias to boot from the SCSI device on ID 6
(or the secondary master for IDE based systems). You may have to use
the actual device name for older OpenBoot versions that don't support
this special command. Note that some problems have been reported on Sun4m
(e.g., Sparc 10s and Sparc 20s) systems booting from CD-ROM.

  <sect2 arch="sparc" id="boot-from-floppies"><title>Booting from Floppies</title>
<para>

Be warned that the newer Sun4u (ultra) architecture does not support
floppy booting. A typical error message is "Bad magic number in disk
label - Can't open disk label package".  Furthermore, a number of
Sun4c models (such as the IPX) do not support the compressed images
found on the disks, so also are not supported.

Several Sparcs (e.g. Ultra 10) have an OBP bug that prevents them from
booting (instead of not supporting booting at all). The appropriate
OBP update can be downloaded as product ID 106121 from
