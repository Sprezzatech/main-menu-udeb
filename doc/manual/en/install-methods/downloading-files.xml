 <title>Downloading Files from Debian Mirrors</title>

<para>

When downloading files from a Debian mirror, be sure to download the
files in <emphasis>binary</emphasis> mode, not text or automatic
mode. It's important to replicate the directory structure you find on
the mirror to create a local `sub-mirror'.

<phrase arch="not-s390">

It isn't really necessary to do this
if you place all the installation files on floppies; but it still
makes it easier to find the files when you need them.

</phrase>

You should start your local directory structure at the level under
<filename>disks-&architecture;</filename>, for example:

<informalexample><screen>
current/<replaceable>subarchitecture</replaceable>/images-1.44
<replaceable arch="i386">/flavor</replaceable>/rescue.bin
</screen></informalexample>

You don't need to download every file under that level, just those
that apply to you (you'll find out which ones apply as you read on).
Just name the directories the same as the mirror's, and keep the files
in their proper directories.

</para><para>

If your machine is set up to automatically decompress/decode files you
download, you must turn that feature off when downloading the
installation system files. They will be decompressed just-in-time by
the installer. Decompressing in your current system will waste space
and time, and if the original compressed archives are deleted by the
decompression program, they won't be there later when the installer
needs them.

</para><para arch="powerpc|m68k">

This is particularly true on the Macintosh, where <filename>.bin</filename>
files are interpreted to be MacBinary, and the decoder's attempts to
convert them will fail noisily. 

</para><para arch="powerpc"> 

Also, many of the binary files such as <filename>yaboot</filename>
will be automatically interpreted as text since they have no file
extensions unless you specifically select binary transfer mode. These
files will be <emphasis>unusable</emphasis> if they are transferred in
text mode.

</para>

  <title>Installation Options</title>
<para> 

For m68k (except VME), the installation system files
(<filename>rescue.bin, linux.bin, root.bin, and
drivers.tgz</filename>) have been compiled into one tarball. You may
also need the base system installation file
<filename>basedebs.tar</filename>.

</para><para> 

If you have a working Ethernet connection on the computer, and your
Ethernet card is of one of the types compiled into the installation
kernel, you may only need the install system tarball.

</para><para> 

If you are installing on a system without a working network
connection, or if your network connection is via PPP (using a modem)
rather than Ethernet, you will also need to download
<filename>basedebs.tar</filename> before starting the installation.  

</para>

Files you may need fall into three categories:

</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>

If you have a working Ethernet connection on the computer, and your
Ethernet card is of one of the types compiled into the installation
kernel, you may only need the install system boot files. The
installer is capable of installing the kernel and drivers over
the network for many common Ethernet cards.

</para><para>

If you have an Ethernet connection for which the installer doesn't
have built-in support, you may need both the install system boot files
and the kernel and peripheral driver installation files. 

</para><para>

If you are installing on a system without a working network
connection, or if your network connection is via PPP (using a modem)
rather than Ethernet, you will need to obtain all three types of files
before starting the installation.

</para><para>

If you're not sure which files you need, just start with the install
system boot files. If your first attempt to configure the network
within the installer fails, you can just quit, get the extra files you
need, and re-start the installation.

</para><para>

The base system installation file 
<filename>basedebs.tar</filename> is currently
about 27M. If you are able to use a CD, or configure your network
before installing the base system, it is better to do so; in that case
you won't need this file. The network location is listed in the
appendix (<xref linkend="base-images"/>).

  <title>Choosing the Right Installation Set</title>
<para>

Installation files include kernel images, which are available in
various <firstterm>flavors</firstterm>.  Each flavor supports a
different set of hardware. The flavors available for &arch-title; are:

<variablelist>
 <varlistentry>
  <term>`vanilla'</term>
<listitem><para>

The standard kernel package available in Debian. This includes almost
all drivers supported by Linux built as modules, which includes
drivers for network devices, SCSI devices, sound cards, Video4Linux
devices, etc. The `vanilla' flavor includes one rescue floppy, one
root and four driver floppies.

</para></listitem>
 </varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
 <term>`compact'</term>
<listitem><para>

Like `vanilla', but with many of the less-frequently-use drivers
removed (sound, v4l, etc). In addition, it has built in support for
several popular PCI Ethernet devices &mdash; NE2000, 3com 3c905,
Tulip, Via-Rhine and Intel EtherExpress Pro100. These built in drivers
allow you to take full advantage of the Debian installer's net install
feature to install the driver floppies over the network so that only
the root and rescue floppy disks need to be made. Finally, `compact'
also supports several common RAID controllers: DAC960, and Compaq's
SMART2 RAID controllers. The `compact' flavor includes one
rescue floppy, one root and two driver disks.

</para></listitem>
 </varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
 <term>`idepci'</term>
<listitem><para>

Kernel that supports only IDE and PCI devices (and a very small number
of ISA devices). This kernel should be used if the SCSI drivers in the
other flavors cause your system to hang on startup (probably because
of resource conflicts, or a misbehaving driver/card in your system.)
The `idepci' flavor also has a built-in ide-floppy driver so that you
can install from LS120 or ZIP devices.

</para></listitem>
 </varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
 <term>`bf2.4'</term>
<listitem><para>

This is an experimental flavor which uses a special version of the
kernel-image-2.4 package. It provides support for newer hardware
components which is absent in the other (more stable) flavors. It
supports more USB hardware, USB keyboards/mice, modern IDE
controllers, some new network cards, and Ext3 and Reiser file systems.
Compared to the driver set of our main kernel-image-2.4.x-yz packages,
some non-essential drivers have been removed in order to keep the
number of needed floppy disks in a sane range. If you have
unexplainable problems with kernel 2.4, you should use other flavors.
If you need more new drivers or optimisations for your CPU type, feel
free to install an "official" kernel-image-2.4.x-yz package. This
flavor comes with one rescue floppy, one root and four driver
floppies.
