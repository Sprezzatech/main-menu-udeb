If you have access to an i386 machine, you can use one of the 
following programs to copy images to floppies.

To use these programs, first make sure that you are booted into
DOS. Trying to use these programs from within a DOS box in Windows, or
double-clicking on these programs from the Windows Explorer is
<emphasis>not</emphasis> expected to work.  If you don't know how to
boot into DOS, just hit <keycap>F8</keycap> while booting.

<command>NTRawrite</command> is a freeware contemporary version of
<command>Rawrite/Rawrite3</command> that is compatible with WinNT and
Win2K. It is a self-explanatory GUI application; you select the disk
drive to write to, browse to the disk image you want to place there
and hit the Write button.

     Modifying the Rescue Floppy to Support National Language
   </title>

<para>

The messages shown by the rescue floppy (before loading the Linux
kernel) can be shown in your mother tongue. To achieve this if you are
not an English speaker, after writing the image file, you must copy
the provided message files and a font to the floppy. For MS-DOS and
Windows users there is a batch file <filename>setlang.bat</filename> in the
<filename>dosutils</filename> directory, which copies the correct
files. Simply enter this directory (e.g.
<userinput>cd c:\debian\dosutils</userinput>) within a command prompt
window, and run
<userinput>setlang <replaceable>lang</replaceable></userinput>, 
where <replaceable>lang</replaceable> is a
two-letter code of your language in lower case, for example
<userinput>setlang pl</userinput> to set the language to Polish. 
Currently these language codes are available:
