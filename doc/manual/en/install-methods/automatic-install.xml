For installing on multiple computers it's possible to use the fully
automatic installation called <command>FAI</command>. The Debian
package <classname>fai</classname> has to be installed on a computer
called the install server. Then all install clients boot from their
network card or floppy disk and automatically install Debian on their
local disks.
