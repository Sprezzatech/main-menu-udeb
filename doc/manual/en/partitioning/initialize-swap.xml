 <title>``Initialize and Activate a Swap Partition''</title>
<para>

This will be the next step once you have created disk partitions. You
have the choice of initializing and activating a new swap partition,
activating a previously-initialized one, or doing without a swap
partition. It's always permissible to re-initialize a swap partition,
so select ``Initialize and Activate a Swap Partition'' unless you are
sure you know what you are doing.

This menu choice will first present you with a dialog box reading
``Please select the partition to activate as a swap device.''. The
default device presented should be the swap partition you've already
set up; if so, just press <emphasis>Enter</emphasis>.

Next, there is a confirmation message, since initialization destroys
any data previously on the partition.  If all is well, select ``Yes''.
The screen will flash as the initialization program runs.

A swap partition is strongly recommended, but you can do without one
if you insist, and if your system has at least 16MB RAM. If you wish
to do this, please select the ``Do Without a Swap Partition'' item
from the menu.
