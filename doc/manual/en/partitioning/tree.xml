 <title>The Directory Tree</title>
<para>

&debian; adheres to the 
<ulink url="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</ulink>
for directory and file naming. This standard allows users and software
programs to predict the location of files and directories. The root
level directory is represented simply by the slash
<filename>/</filename>. At the root level, all Debian systems include
these directories:

<informalexample><screen>
       bin       Essential command binaries
       boot      Static files of the boot loader
       dev       Device files
       etc       Host-specific system configuration
       home      User home directories
       lib       Essential shared libraries and kernel modules
       mnt       Mount point for mounting a file system temporarily
       proc      Virtual directory for system information
       root      Home directory for the root user
       sbin      Essential system binaries
       tmp       Temporary files
       usr       Secondary hierarchy
       var       Variable data
       opt       Add-on application software packages

</para>

<para>

The following is a list of important considerations regarding
directories and partitions.

</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>

The root partition <filename>/</filename> must always physically
contain <filename>/etc</filename>, <filename>/bin</filename>,
<filename>/sbin</filename>, <filename>/lib</filename> and
<filename>/dev</filename>, otherwise you won't be able to boot.
Typically 100 MB is needed for the root partition, but this may vary.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

<filename>/usr</filename>: all user programs
(<filename>/usr/bin</filename>), libraries
(<filename>/usr/lib</filename>), documentation
(<filename>/usr/share/doc</filename>), etc., are in this
directory. This part of the file system needs most of the space. You
should provide at least 500 MB of disk space. If you want to install
more packages you should increase the amount of space you give this
directory.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

<filename>/home</filename>: every user will put his data into a
subdirectory of this directory. The size of this depends on how many
users will be using the system and what files are to be stored in
their directories.  Depending on your planned usage you should reserve
about 100 MB for each user, but adapt this value to your needs.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

<filename>/var</filename>: all variable data like news articles,
e-mails, web sites, the packaging system cache, etc. will be placed
under this directory. The size of this directory depends greatly on
the usage of your computer, but for most people will be dictated by
the package management tool's overhead.  If you are going to do a full
installation of just about everything Debian has to offer, all in one
session, setting aside 2 or 3 gigabytes of space for
<filename>/var</filename> should be sufficient. If you are going to
install in pieces (that is to say, install services and utilities,
followed by text stuff, then X, ...), you can get away with 300 - 500
megabytes in <filename>/var</filename>.  If hard drive space is at a
premium and you don't plan on doing major system updates, you can get
by with as little as 30 or 40 megabytes in <filename>/var</filename>.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

<filename>/tmp</filename>: if a program creates temporary data it will
most likely go in <filename>/tmp</filename>. 20-50 MB should usually
be enough.

</para></listitem>
