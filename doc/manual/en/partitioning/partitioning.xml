<title>Partitioning for Debian</title>
<para>

The ``Partition a Hard Disk'' menu item presents you with a list of disk
drives you can partition, and runs a partitioning application.  You
must create at least one ``Linux native'' <![ %i386; [(type 83)]]>
 disk partition, and you probably want at least one ``Linux swap'' 
<![ %i386; [(type 82)]]> partition.

</para>

<para>

On &arch-title; you have to attach disks to the system before starting
with the partitioning. You will be prompted with the list of available
but not yet attached disks when selecting the 'Attach' task.
