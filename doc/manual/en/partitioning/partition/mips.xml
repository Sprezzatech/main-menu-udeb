SGI Indys require an SGI disk label in order to make the system bootable 
from hard disk. It can be created in the fdisk expert menu. The thereby
created volume header(partition number 9) should be at least 3MB large.
In order to be able to store several different kernels in it a size of
10MB is recommended. If the volume header created is too small, you can 
simply delete partition number 9 and re-add it with a different size. Note
that the volume header must start at sector 0.
