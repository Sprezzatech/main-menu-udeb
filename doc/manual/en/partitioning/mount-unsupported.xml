 <title>Mounting Partitions Not Supported by <command>debian-installer</command>
 </title>

<para>

In some special situations, <command>debian-installer</command> might
not know how to mount your file systems (whether root or otherwise).
It may be possible, if you're an experienced GNU/Linux user, to simply
go to <userinput>tty2</userinput> by pressing
<userinput>Alt</userinput> and <userinput>F2</userinput> keys
together, and manually run the commands you need to run in order to
mount the partition in question.

</para><para>

If you are mounting a root partition for your new system, just mount
it to <filename>/target</filename>, the go back to debian-installer
and continue (perhaps running the ``View the Partition Table'' step to
cause <command>debian-installer</command> to re-compute where it is in
the installation process.

</para><para>

For non-root partitions, you'll have to remember to manually modify
your new <filename>fstab</filename> file so that when you reboot the
partition will be mounted.  Wait for that file
(<filename>/target/etc/fstab</filename>) to be written by
<command>debian-installer</command>, of course, before editing it.
