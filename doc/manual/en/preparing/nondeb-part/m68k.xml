If you are running AmigaOS, you can use the <command>HDToolBox</command>
program to adjust your native partitions prior to installation.

  <sect2><title>Partitioning in Atari TOS</title>
<para>

Atari partition IDs are three ASCII characters, use ``LNX'' for data
and ``SWP'' for swap partitions. If using the low memory installation
method, a small Minix partition is also needed (about 2 MB), for which
the partition ID is ``MNX''.  Failure to set the appropriate partition
IDs not only prevents the Debian installation process from recognizing
the partitions, but also results in TOS attempting to use the Linux
partitions, which confuses the hard disk driver and renders the whole
disk inaccessible.

</para><para>

There are a multitude of third party partitioning tools available (the
Atari <command>harddisk</command> utility doesn't permit changing the
partition ID); this manual cannot give detailed descriptions for all
of them. The following description covers <command>SCSITool</command> (from
Hard+Soft GmBH).

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>

Start <command>SCSITool</command> and select the disk you want to partition
(``Disk'' menu, item ``select'').

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

From the ``Partition'' menu, select either ``New'' to add new
partitions or change the existing partition sizes, or ``Change'' to
change one specific partition.  Unless you have already created
partitions with the right sizes and only want to change the partition
ID, ``New'' is probably the best choice.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

For the ``New'' choice, select ``existing'' in the dialog box
prompting the initial settings. The next window shows a list of
existing partitions which you can adjust using the scroll buttons, or
by clicking in the bar graphs. The first column in the partition list
is the partition type; just click on the text field to edit it.  When
you are finished changing partition settings, save the changes by
leaving the window with the ``OK'' button.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

For the ``Change'' option, select the partition to change in the
selection list, and select ``other systems'' in the dialog box.  The
next window lists detailed information about the location of this
partition, and lets you change the partition ID.  Save changes by
leaving the window with the ``OK'' button.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Write down the Linux names for each of the partitions you created or
changed for use with Linux &mdash; see <xref linkend="device-names"></xref>.

</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>

Quit <command>SCSITool</command> using the ``Quit'' item from the ``File''
menu.  The computer will reboot to make sure the changed partition
table is used by TOS. If you changed any TOS/GEM partitions, they will
be invalidated and have to be reinitialized (we told you to back up
everything on the disk, didn't we?).

There is a partitioning tool for Linux/m68k called
<command>atari-fdisk</command> in the installation system, but for now we
recommend you partition your disk using a TOS partition editor or some
disk tool. If your partition editor doesn't have an option to edit the
partition type, you can do this crucial step at a later stage (from
the booted temporary install RAMdisk).  <command>SCSITool</command> is only
one of the partition editors we know of which supports selection of
arbitrary partition types. There may be others; select the tool that
suits your needs.

  <sect2><title>Partitioning in MacOS</title>
<para>

Partitioning tools for Macintosh tested include <command>pdisk</command>,
<command>HD SC Setup</command> 7.3.5 (Apple), <command>HDT</command> 1.8 (FWB),
<command>SilverLining</command> (LaCie), and <command>DiskTool</command> (Tim
Endres, GPL). Full versions are required for <command>HDT</command> and
<command>SilverLining</command>. The Apple tool requires a patch in order
to recognize third-party disks (a description on how to patch <command>HD
SC Setup</command> using <command>ResEdit</command> can be found at 
<ulink url="http://www.euronet.nl/users/ernstoud/patch.html"></ulink>).

</para><para>

For IDE based Macs, you need to use <command>Apple Drive Setup</command> to create
empty space for the Linux partitions, and complete the partitioning under
Linux, or use the MacOS version of pdisk available from the MkLinux FTP
server.
