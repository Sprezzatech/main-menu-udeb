  <title>Firmware Revisions and Existing OS Setup</title>

&arch-title; machines are generally self-configuring and do not require
firmware configuration.  However, you should make sure that you have
the appropriate ROM and system patches.  On the Macintosh, MacOS
version >= 7.1 is recommended because version 7.0.1 contains a bug in
the video drivers preventing the boot loader from deactivating the
video interrupts, resulting in a boot hang.  The Amiga bootstrap
requires <filename>ixemul.library</filename>, a version of which is
distributed on the CD-ROM. On the BVM VMEbus systems you should make
sure you are using BVMBug revision G or higher boot ROMs.  The BVMBug
boot ROMs do not come as standard on the BVM systems but are available
from BVM on request free of charge.
