 <title>Pre-Partitioning for Multi-Boot Systems</title>
<para>

Partitioning your disk simply refers to the act of breaking up your
disk into sections. Each section is then independent of the others.
It's roughly equivalent to putting up walls inside a house; if you add
furniture to one room it doesn't affect any other room.

Whenever this section talks about ``disks'' you should translate this
into a DASD or VM minidisk in the &arch-title; world. Also a machine means
an LPAR or VM guest in this case.

If you already have an operating system on your system

and want to stick Linux on the same disk, you will need to repartition
the disk. Debian requires its own hard disk partitions. It cannot be
installed on Windows or MacOS partitions. It may be able to share some
partitions with other Linux systems, but that's not covered here. At
the very least you will need a dedicated partition for the Debian
root.

You can find information about your current partition setup by using
a partitioning tool for your current operating system

<phrase arch="i386">, such as fdisk or PartitionMagic</phrase>

<phrase arch="m68k">, such as HD SC Setup, HDToolBox, or SCSITool</phrase>

. Partitioning tools always provide a way to show existing partitions
without making changes.

In general, changing a partition with a file system already on
it will destroy any information there. Thus you should always make
backups before doing any repartitioning.  Using the analogy of the
house, you would probably want to move all the furniture out of the
way before moving a wall or you risk destroying it.
