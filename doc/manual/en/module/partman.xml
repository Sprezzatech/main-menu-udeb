   <sect2 id="partman"><title>Partitioning Your Disks</title>
<para>

Now it is time to partition your disks. First you will be given the
opportunity to automatically partition either an entire drive, or free
space on a drive. If you do not want to autopartition, choose
<guimenuitem>manual</guimenuitem> from the menu.

</para><para>

On the next screen you will see your partition table, how the
partitions will be formatted, and where they will be mounted.
If you did automatic partitioning, you should just be able to choose
<guimenuitem>Finished partitioning</guimenuitem> from the menu to use
what it set up.

</para><para>

Select partititons from the list to modify or delete them. If you have
free space it will also show up under a drive, and you can select it
to create new partitions. When modifying a partition you will have the
opportunity to choose the file system to use, and where to mount
it. The partitioning menu also has a choice at the bottom that can be
used to automatically partition a drive or existing free space on
a drive, if you'd rather go that route. Be sure to create at least two
partitions, one for <emphasis>swap</emphasis> and one for the
<emphasis>root</emphasis> filesystem (which must be mounted as
<filename>/</filename>).

</para><para>

Capabilities of <command>partman</command> can be extended with
installer modules, so if you can't see all promised goodies, check if
you have loaded all required modules
(e.g. <filename>partman-ext3</filename>,
<filename>partman-xfs</filename>, or
<filename>partman-lvm</filename>).

</para><para>

After finishing partitioning, select <guimenuitem>Finished
partitioning</guimenuitem> from the menu, and confirm that the
filesystems should be created as requested.
