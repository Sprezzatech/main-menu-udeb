  <sect2 id="lang-chooser"><title>Language Chooser</title>
<para>

As the first step of the installation, select the language in which
you want the installation process to take place.  Some languages have
variants available.  Pick whichever variant applies to your geographic
region.

The answers you provide will be used to pick the language which the
installer will use, and to set a suitable keyboard layout. Later in
the process, they will be used to pick the default Debian Mirror
Server for your probably geographic location.  If the choices made
by the installer are not suitable, you can make a different choice.
