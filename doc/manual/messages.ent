In order boot your system, you must create a boot floppy. It won't be bootable without one.
The most common reason for LILO installation failure is a kernel disk location extending beyond the 1023rd cylinder. With an older BIOS, LILO is unable to load any block of the kernel from a disk cylinder numbered higher than 1023. This is often a problem with disks larger than 524MB or so. One way to solve the problem is to make a small (5-10Mb) partition at the beginning of the disk and mount it on &quot;/boot&quot;, so that the entire &quot;/boot&quot; partition will be below the 1023rd cylinder. Please refer to the installation manual for further information.

EF, and with GPT it is a partition with the boot flag set, and

program with online help, accessed by typing help at the prompt.

than some identifier in the partition table, it is important that
you use parted to create filesystems (or swap space) in any GPT

(MBR) and the alternative `mbr' program both have support for large
disks if you have a modern (newer than early 1994-98) BIOS that
supports LBA and the &quot;Enhanced Disk Drive Support Specification&quot;.
Therefore, if you are certain that your BIOS supports the int 0x13
large disk access extensions, you may partition your drive however you
like.

However, if you have an older BIOS, neither Lilo's MBR nor the
alternative `mbr' will be able to load any block of the kernel from a
disk cylinder numbered higher than 1023.  This is often a problem with
disks larger than 528MB, coupled with an older (pre 1995-98, depending
on the manufacturer) BIOS that does not support the int 0x13 large
disk access extensions.  If your BIOS supports LBA or CHS Translation
(aka &quot;Large&quot;), but does not have the large disk extensions, the MBR
will be able to address anything below the translated 1024th cylinder,
usually around 8GB.

One way to solve the problem is to make a small (5-10Mb) partition at
the beginning of the disk, so that the entire partition is below the
1023rd cylinder.  For example, make a 5-10Mb primary partition in the
low cylinder range, marked bootable, another for swap space, one for
&quot;/&quot;, and whatever other partitions you like.  Before you install the
operating system and modules, after you have mounted your &quot;/&quot;
partition, initialize and mount that small partition on &quot;/boot&quot;.
This is where the OS kernel will be stored, and thus, Lilo will find
that all blocks of the kernel reside below the 1024 cylinder boundary.

Please refer to the partitioning section in the Installation Manual
for slightly more detailed information and references to relevant
documentation concerning the BIOS large disk access extensions.''">
