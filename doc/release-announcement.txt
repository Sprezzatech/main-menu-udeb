THIS IS A DRAFT



















































The Debian-Installer team is glad to announce the third and final beta
release of the Debian sarge installer. New features in this release include:

  - new easy to use partitioner that supports automatic partitioning and LVM
  - grub as the default boot loader on i386
  - wireless networking support
  - 2.4.25 kernel, with SATA support and security fixes
  - support for the XFS filesystem
  - support for new architectures: sparc, m68k (mac), TO BE DETERMINED
  - fully translated to 25 languages
  - a boot logo (by Mark Riedesel)
  - a draft installation manual is available at
    http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/

This release fixes all of the posted errata in beta 2 of the
Debian-Installer, and many other bugs besides. We anticipate that most
users will find it a great improvement from past betas. Please send us a
report of how your installation goes, so we can strive to make it even
better.

How to try out the beta:

   - Download one of the available CD or other images from the d-i website,
     http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer
   - Read the INSTALLATION HOWTO or manual before installing.
   - File an install report as a bug against the pseudo-package 
     'installation-reports' in the Debian bug tracking system. If your
     installation was successful, there will be a template for install
     reports in /root/install-report.template. This template is also
     available on the web. Please use this template when filing
     installation reports.

We appreciate all the testing and feedback we've received for past versions
of the installer, and hope this one is the best one yet!
