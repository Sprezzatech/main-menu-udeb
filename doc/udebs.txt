Explanation of the UDEB Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A .udeb is just a deb archive with several changes to the details:

New Control Scripts
===================

menutest
--------
Menutest scripts should return a true value (0) if they think it would be a
good idea if their menu item was default, and a false value if it seems making
their menu item the default would not be a smart decision.

Menutest scripts are optional. If a module does not have one, a simpler
default test is used.

isinstallable (not supported yet in main-menu)
-------------

If this script exists, and when run returns a non-zero value, then
its menu item is not displayed.

New Headers
===========

installer-menu-item
-------------------

A priority (a number). The priority number influsences the
ordering of items in the menu; higher numbered items are closer to the
end of the menu. If this field does not appear, or has a value of 0, a module
will not appear on the main menu.
