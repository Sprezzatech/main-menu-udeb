<h1>Debcamp for debian-installer</h1>

<p>To speed up the development of debian-installer, the foundation
behind Skolelinux believe it is useful to sponsor another debcamp for
the d-i developers.  The debcamp should be low-cost, and located
somewhat close to most developers to keep transport costs low.  The
initial idea is to place it somewhere in Germany, as several
developers are located in Europe.  Kurt Gramlich has volunteered to
look at the local organizing part.<p>



<h2>Organizers</h2>
