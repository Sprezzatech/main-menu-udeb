<h1>Debcamp for debian-installer</h1>

<p>To speed up the development of debian-installer, the foundation
behind Skolelinux believe it is useful to sponsor another debcamp for
the d-i developers.  The debcamp should be low-cost, and located
somewhat close to most developers to keep transport costs low.  The
initial idea is to place it somewhere in Germany, as several
developers are located in Europe.  Kurt Gramlich has volunteered to
look at the local organizing part.<p>



<h2>Organizers</h2>

<p>Debian-side: Petter Reinholdtsen, Andreas Schuldei</p>

<p>Local side: Kurt Gramlich</p>

<h2>Date and location</h2>

<p>The d-i debcamp will be co-located with the
<a href="http://oldenburger.linuxtage.de/Oldenburg2003">Oldenburg
Linux Developers Meeting</a>, south-west of Bremen/Hamburg.</p>

<p>Train tickets are cheaper if they are bought at least three days
before the trip. Information and online ordering can be done at
the website of the
<a href="http://www.bahn.de/pv/uebersicht/die_bahn_international_guests.shtml">
"Deutsche Bahn AG"</a>.</p>

<h2>Planned work</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>Joey Hess</dt>
  <dd>base-config, retreiver selection in anna, main-menu, and
    whatever else comes up.</dd>

  <dt>Sven Luther</dt>
  <dd>I plan to follow on the work i did at the oslo debcamp (parted
    support for the amiga partitioning system used in the pegasos
    motherboards) and work on debian-installer support on the pegasos
    motherboard. Maybe this would include some kernel work or something
    else, depending on the status of debian-installer at that time. I
    would also be interested in the graphical installer, and more exactly
    the graphical partitioning support, but it is too early to tell about
    it yet.</dd>
