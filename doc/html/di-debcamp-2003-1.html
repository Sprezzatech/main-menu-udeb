<h1>Debcamp for debian-installer</h1>

<p>To speed up the development of debian-installer, the foundation
behind Skolelinux believe it is useful to sponsor another debcamp for
the d-i developers.  The debcamp should be low-cost, and located
somewhat close to most developers to keep transport costs low.  The
initial idea is to place it somewhere in Germany, as several
developers are located in Europe.  Kurt Gramlich has volunteered to
look at the local organizing part.<p>



<h2>Organizers</h2>

<p>Debian-side: Petter Reinholdtsen, Andreas Schuldei</p>

<p>Local side: Kurt Gramlich</p>

<h2>Date and location</h2>

<p>The d-i debcamp will be co-located with the
<a href="http://oldenburger.linuxtage.de/Oldenburg2003">Oldenburg
Linux Developers Meeting</a>, south-west of Bremen/Hamburg.</p>

<p>Train tickets are cheaper if they are bought at least three days
before the trip. Information and online ordering can be done at
the website of the
<a href="http://www.bahn.de/pv/uebersicht/die_bahn_international_guests.shtml">
"Deutsche Bahn AG"</a>.</p>

<h2>Planned work</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>Goswin Brederlow</dt>
  <dd>I plan to do work on the alpha support or m68k(Amiga) support
    (depending what system I take with me). Also on the cooperation of
    d-i with debix for a more easy CD version of D-I (a lot more
    automatically installed udeb and much more autodetection). That also
    means I will work on the graphical installer since debix will have
    X. I know about the Amiga partitioning system (should have the specs
    here somewhere too) so Sven Luthers parted work sounds intresting
    too.</dd>

  <dt>Joey Hess</dt>
  <dd>base-config, retreiver selection in anna, main-menu, and
    whatever else comes up.</dd>

  <dt>Sebastian Ley</dt>
  <dd>I was thinking to do bug fixing, but in general I would cover
    any tasks to get the beta out.</dd>

  <dt>Sven Luther</dt>
  <dd>I plan to follow on the work i did at the oslo debcamp (parted
    support for the amiga partitioning system used in the pegasos
    motherboards) and work on debian-installer support on the pegasos
    motherboard. Maybe this would include some kernel work or something
    else, depending on the status of debian-installer at that time. I
    would also be interested in the graphical installer, and more exactly
    the graphical partitioning support, but it is too early to tell about
    it yet.</dd>

  <dt>Martin Sjögren</dt>
  <dd>Well... Everything? Mainly anna, retrievers, main-menu and
    partconf, I guess.</dd>
