<h1>Debcamp for debian-installer</h1>

<p>To speed up the development of debian-installer, the foundation
behind Skolelinux believes it is useful to sponsor another debcamp for
the d-i developers.  The debcamp should be low-cost, and located
somewhat close to most developers to keep transport costs low.  The
initial idea is to let it take place somewhere in Germany, as several
developers are located in Europe.  Kurt Gramlich has volunteered to
look at the local organizing part.<p>



<h2>Organizers</h2>

<p>Debian-side: Petter Reinholdtsen, Andreas Schuldei</p>

<p>Local side: Kurt Gramlich</p>

<h2>Date and location</h2>

<p>The d-i debcamp will be co-located with the
<a href="http://oldenburger.linuxtage.de/Oldenburg2003">Oldenburg
Linux Developers Meeting</a> (<b>updated</b>), west of Bremen/Hamburg.</p>

<p>Train tickets are cheaper if they are bought at least three days
before the trip. Information and online ordering can be done at
the website of the
<a href="http://www.bahn.de/pv/uebersicht/die_bahn_international_guests.shtml">
"Deutsche Bahn AG"</a>.</p>

<dl>

  <dt>Date:</dt>
  <dd>Thursday 2003-09-25 to Sunday 2003-09-28.</dd>
  <dd>One can arrive as early as wednesday. People usually start
  leaving around 13.00 on Sunday</dd>

  <dt>Location:</dt>
  <dd>University Oldenburg, Germany</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Getting there</h2>

<p>The closes airport is Bremen airport, and the closest railway
station is Oldenburg Railway station. Other airports are
Groningen (Netherlands, serviced by Ryanair from London) and Hamburg (biggest in northern Germany)</p>

<p>The recommended way to get to the event is to be picked up by
some kind soul going there by car. Alternatives are public
transport or taxi-cabs. Train connections to Oldenburg from
Bremen or Hamburg are ok (1.5h from hamburg, 25min to 45 min
from bremen, depending on the train.), the one to Groninge is rather
time-consuming (3h). One can get from Oldenburg station to the uni with
<a href="http://www.vwg.de/index_e.html">"public transport"</a>.
Buses 306 (to C. v. Ossietzky Str.) and 310 (to Wehnen), if one is
willing to walk a short bit. There is a search engine on the site
for point to point travel. If someone finds an english page
there, let me know. We will coordinate a pick-up
service from bremen airport to the uni. Please contact <a
href="mailto:andreas@debian.org">Andreas</A> for
details. It would be beneficial if you could try to hit the
thursday 16.00 mark for arrival in bremen. Same for the way back.</p>

<p>I'd advise against using the 310 if you carry more than 10kg and
don't know the location.  &mdash;&nbsp;Joey.</p>

<p><b>Need info on alternative airports, how to get from the airport
and railway station to the university.  Need travel time estimates.
Need map reference and some distances (to airport, hamburg, etc).
Need link to flight information search site.  Need suggestions for
travel route.</b></p>

<p>If you tell me when you arrive either at the airport Bremen or at
the train station in Oldenburg, I can pick up up by car.  Just
negotiate with me (oh, and no more than three people at the same time).
&mdash;&nbsp;Joey</p>

<h2>Staying there</h2>

<p>According to people who were there before, the event is
relaxed and not over-organized. There used to be two seminar
roomes, one for hacking, the other one for sleeping. The hacking
and sleeping was handled flexible in the past. The excellent
university cafeteria will be open during the week (Thursday and Friday)
for lunch (11:30-14:00). In the proximity of the university there
are restaurants and pubs for dinner or other occasions. Breakfast
was provided. One would need to sign up with <a
href="mailto:joey@debian.org">Joey</A> and order the number of
rolls one would like to eat. In the past participants were asked
to pay between 5 to 15 Euro for everything (not sure if the
cafeteria was included there). You should bring sleeping bag and
camping pad yourself.</p>

<p>There will be twisted pair network, wlan is uncertain. One
should bring his own box. It is unlikely that one is allowed to
use the computers in the data-pools for hacking or testing.</p>


<p><b>Need info regarding sleeping areas, network (wlan?), suggested
time of arrival and departure.  Will there be computers there, or do
we need to bring laptops?</b></p>

<p>For sleeping plese refer to the  <a
href="http://oldenburger.linuxtage.de/Oldenburg2003/general.html">web
page</a>.  WLAN can only be used by us if somebody takes an AP with
him (can probably be arranged, let me know if this is required).
You'll have to take your computer with you.  We can't use University
computers for hacking.  &mdash;&nbsp;Joey</p>

<h2>Planned work</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>Goswin Brederlow</dt>
  <dd>I plan to do work on the alpha support or m68k(Amiga) support
    (depending what system I take with me). Also on the cooperation of
    d-i with debix for a more easy CD version of D-I (a lot more
    automatically installed udeb and much more autodetection). That also
    means I will work on the graphical installer since debix will have
    X. I know about the Amiga partitioning system (should have the specs
    here somewhere too) so Sven Luthers parted work sounds intresting
    too.</dd>

  <dt>Joey Hess</dt>
  <dd>base-config, retreiver selection in anna, main-menu, and
    whatever else comes up.</dd>

  <dt>Sebastian Ley</dt>
  <dd>I was thinking to do bug fixing, but in general I would cover
    any tasks to get the beta out.</dd>

  <dt>Sven Luther</dt>
  <dd>I plan to follow on the work i did at the oslo debcamp (parted
    support for the amiga partitioning system used in the pegasos
    motherboards) and work on debian-installer support on the pegasos
    motherboard. Maybe this would include some kernel work or something
    else, depending on the status of debian-installer at that time. I
    would also be interested in the graphical installer, and more exactly
    the graphical partitioning support, but it is too early to tell about
    it yet.</dd>

  <dt>Thorsten Sauter</dt>
  <dd>I plan to finishing the d-i powerpc/ibook port. Maybe completing the
    raidmgr udeb. And everything other. :-)</dd>

  <dt>Martin Sjögren</dt>
  <dd>Well... Everything? Mainly anna, retrievers, main-menu and
    partconf, I guess.</dd>
