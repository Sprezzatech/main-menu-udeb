The new debian installer is highly modular. Modules are loaded at several
points in the install process to add capabilities to the installer. Modules
are essentially sets of files that get unpacked onto the installation
system, plus some metadata.

Because there is already so much infrastructure to build and manage debian
packages, and because it allows metadata to accompny the files in a module,
we have decided to use debian packages as the modules for the installer.

Unlike regular debian packages, modules for the installer will not be
policy compliant. They will not contain documentation in /usr/share/doc.
They need not comply with the FHS. They may be statically linked. They may
conflict with essential "real" debian packages, and thus be non-installable
on a real debian system, although it is recommended that if possible, this
be avoided.

<Detail where the modules will go in the debian archive, and any way they
can be distinguised from "real" debs.>

Modules will not be installed by a full-fledged dpkg implementation, so the
following features of regular debs will not be supported:
<This is not set in stone, but let's not implement this stuff unless we
need it.>
	* pre-dependancies
	* preinst, postrm and prerm
	* conflicts
	* versioned dependancies
	* provides
	* essential or required packages
	* suggests

The following will be supported:
