Modules
-------

The new debian installer is highly modular. Modules are loaded at several
points in the install process to add capabilities to the installer. Modules
are essentially sets of files that get unpacked onto the installation
system, plus some metadata.

Because there is already so much infrastructure to build and manage debian
packages, and because it allows metadata to accompany the files in a module,
we have decided to use debian packages as the modules for the installer. To
differentiate from "real" debian packages, installer modules should have an
extention of ".udeb"

Unlike regular debian packages, modules for the installer will not be
policy compliant. They will not contain documentation in /usr/share/doc.
They need not comply with the FHS. They may be statically linked. They may
conflict with essential "real" debian packages, and thus be non-installable
on a real debian system, although it is recommended that if possible, this
be avoided.

To differentiate them from normal Debian packages, modules have filenames
ending in ".udeb". However, modules must not have the same package name as
any regular Debian package.

Modules will not be installed by a full-fledged dpkg implementation, so the
following features of regular debs will not be supported:

[ This is not set in stone, but let's not implement this stuff unless we
need it. ]

	- pre-dependancies
	- preinst, postrm and prerm
	- conflicts
	- versioned dependancies
	- essential or required packages
	- suggests
	- recommends
	- `|' in dependancies.

The following will be supported:
	- simple dependancies
	- postinst
	- debconf
	- provides
