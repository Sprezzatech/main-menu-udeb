Some clues for translators
==========================

When starting to translate debian-installer, you should first make
sure to get your language choice included, then translate the core
udebs, next translate the common udebs, and finally complete the rest
of the udebs.  The second stage installer should also be translated,
but it consists of normal deb-packages, and not udebs.

Suggested translation order:

-languagechooser
-common udebs
-supported architectures udebs
-second stage
-future architectures udebs

You may send your translations as bug reports against the given
packages.  The packages names are the last part of the lines below
(for instance, "languagechooser" for tools/languagechooser).
Some packages have different names which are mentioned when needed.

For bug reports, please use the "d-i" tag.

You may also send the translations to the debian-boot mailing list.
Please use [INTL] [xx] in Subjects where xx is your language code
(xx_yy for some languages such as brazilian portuguese).

If you have CVS write access, don't forget to update changelogs and
remember: changelog files use UTF-8!! The debian-installer CVS is hosted on
alioth.debian.org ("debian-installer" and "base-config" projects).

For getting up-to-date files for your language and know the
translation status for the d-i core packages, use the following URL:
http://people.debian.org/~barbier/d-i/l10n/

If a translation team exists for your language, WORK WITH THEM. First
check the debian-l10n-xxxxx mailing list where xxxxx is your language
name in english (e.g. debian-l10n-polish, debian-l10n-portuguese...).

For general translation issues or for finding other translators for
your language, you may also use the debian-i18n mailing list (don't
post translations there, however).

 discover (debconf)

This guide is supposed to be be a first start for translators.  There
are probably errors, and some packages we forgot.  Please add them if
you discover such packages, and fix it if you find errors.
