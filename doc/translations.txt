Some clues for translators
==========================

When starting to translate debian-installer, you should first make
sure to get your langauge choice included, then translated the core
udebs, next translate the common udebs, and finally complete the rest
of the udebs.  The second stage installer should also be translated,
but it consists of normal deb-packages, and not udebs.

Language choice
---------------

tools/languagechooser

Core udebs
----------

tools/cdebconf
anna
main-menu
kbd-chooser
base-installer
prebaseconfig
utils

Common udebs
------------

ddetect
cdrom-detect
retriever/cdrom
retriever/floppy
netcfg
retriever/net
retriever/choose-mirror
cdrom-checker
grub-installer
lilo-installer
iso-scan
bugreporter-udeb
partitioner
partconf

Second stage
------------

base-config
passwd
console-data
discover
tasksel
aptitude
dselect
apt
dpkg
exim4-config

This guide is supposed to be be a first start for translators.  There
are probably errors, and some packages I forgot.  Please add them if
you discover such packages, and fix it if you find errors.
