Some clues for translators
==========================


Translation order
-----------------

When starting to translate debian-installer, you should first make
sure to get your language choice included, then translate the core
udebs, next translate the common udebs, and finally complete the rest
of the udebs.  The second stage installer should also be translated,
but it consists of normal deb-packages, and not udebs.

Suggested translation order:

-languagechooser
  (read debian-installer/tools/languagechooser/README.trans for details)
-common udebs
-supported architectures udebs
-second stage
-future architectures udebs

See the complete packages list at the end of this document.

How to get files to be translated
---------------------------------

-Go to http://people.debian.org/~barbier/d-i/l10n/xx where xx is your
 language ISO code (or xx_YY for languages which have country-dependent
 flavours such as pt_BR or zh_CN).

-Look at the STATUS.utf8.txt file

-For files reported as missing, go pick up the templates.pot file
 in the debian-installer CVS :
 http://cvs.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/debian-installer/?cvsroot=d-i.
 
 Example : 
 "Missing file: debian-installer/retriever/choose-mirror/debian/po/xx.po"
 --> pick up http://cvs.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/debian-installer/retriever/choose-mirror/debian/po/templates.pot?cvsroot=d-i

 Rename this file to xx.po and start working on it

-For files reported as incomplete, get the file in
 http://people.debian.org/~barbier/d-i/l10n/xx and complete it. Don't
 forget to contact the original translator (see PO file header)

 Rename this file to xx.po and start working on it

How to translate
----------------
This document is not intended to be a tutorial for gettext-related
stuff. Please look for documentation of PO editing software such as
KBabel, PoEdit, EMacs PO-mode, etc.

Please use a dedicated PO-editing tool unless you become very familiar
with translation work.

Don't forget to properly fill up the PO files header, especially the
Last-Translator field.

If a translation team exists for your language, WORK WITH THEM. First
check the debian-l10n-xxxxx mailing list where xxxxx is your language
name in english (e.g. debian-l10n-polish, debian-l10n-portuguese...).

For general translation issues or for finding other translators for
your language, you may also use the debian-i18n mailing list (don't
post translations there, however).


How to get your work included in debian-installer
-------------------------------------------------

Choose either of the methods below. CVS commits are encouraged. Create
an alioth account and ask in -boot for getting write access.

 CVS commit
 ----------
If you have CVS write access, don't forget to update changelogs and
remember: changelog files use UTF-8!! The debian-installer CVS is hosted on
alioth.debian.org ("debian-installer" and "base-config" projects).

 File a bug
 ----------
You may send your translations as bug reports against the given
packages.  The packages names are the last part of the lines below
(for instance, "languagechooser" for tools/languagechooser).
Some packages have different names which are mentioned when needed.

For bug reports, please use the "d-i" tag.

 Send to debian-boot
 -------------------
You may also send the translations to the debian-boot mailing list.
Please use [INTL:xx] in Subjects where xx is your language code
(or xx_YY)

 Post-reboot installation stage
 ------------------------------

 (some of these packages do not only need debconf-type translation, but
 also program translation)

 Translations must be reported as wishlist bugs against these
 packages.  

 Base-config is an exception because it is maintained by the debian-boot
 team, so other methods (CVS commits and -boot filing) may apply for it.
 Note that it is a separate project on alioth.
  
 base-config (debconf)
 shadow (debconf+programs)
 console-data (debconf)
 discover (debconf)
 tasksel (debconf)
 aptitude (programs)
 dselect (programs)
 apt (programs)
 dpkg (programs)
 exim4-config (debconf)




This guide is supposed to be be a first start for translators.  There
are probably errors, and some packages we forgot.  Please add them if
you discover such packages, and fix it if you find errors.
