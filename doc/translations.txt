Some clues for translators
==========================

When starting to translate debian-installer, you should first make
sure to get your language choice included, then translate the core
udebs, next translate the common udebs, and finally complete the rest
of the udebs.  The second stage installer should also be translated,
but it consists of normal deb-packages, and not udebs.

You may send your translations as bug reports against the given
packages.  The packages names are the last part of the lines below
(for instance, "languagechooser" for tools/languagechooser).
Some packages have different names which are given below.

You may also send the translations to the debian-boot mailing
list.  Please use [INTL] [xx] in Subjects where xx is your language
code (xx_yy for some languages such as brazilian portuguese).

If you have CVS write access, don't forget to update changelogs and
remember: changelog files use UTF-8!!

For getting up-to-date files for your language and know the
translations status, use the following URL:

This guide is supposed to be be a first start for translators.  There
are probably errors, and some packages we forgot.  Please add them if
you discover such packages, and fix it if you find errors.
