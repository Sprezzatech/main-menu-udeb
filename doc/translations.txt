Debian Installer notes for translation and internationalisation
---------------------------------------------------------------

(if you happen to modify this file, please don't forget to update the
 trailing changelog)

Translation order
-----------------

When starting to translate debian-installer, you should first make
sure to get your language choice included, then translate the core
udebs, next translate the common udebs, and finally complete the rest
of the udebs.  The second stage installer should also be translated,
but it consists of normal deb-packages, and not udebs.

Suggested translation order:

-languagechooser
  (read debian-installer/tools/languagechooser/README.trans for details)
-countrychooser and iso-codes (see APPENDIX)
-core udebs and console-data (see APPENDIX)
-common udebs
-supported architectures udebs
-second stage
-future architectures udebs
-prospective packages (not yet included in d-i)

See the complete packages list at the end of this document.

How to get files to be translated
---------------------------------

-Go to http://people.debian.org/~barbier/d-i/l10n/xx where xx is your
 language ISO code (or xx_YY for languages which have country-dependent
 flavours such as pt_BR or zh_CN).

-Look at the STATUS.utf8.txt file

-For files reported as missing, go pick up the templates.pot file
 in the debian-installer CVS:
 http://cvs.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/debian-installer/?cvsroot=d-i.
 
 Example: 
 "Missing file: debian-installer/retriever/choose-mirror/debian/po/xx.po"
 --> pick up http://cvs.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/debian-installer/retriever/choose-mirror/debian/po/templates.pot?cvsroot=d-i

 Rename this file to xx.po and start working on it

-For files reported as incomplete, get the file in
 http://people.debian.org/~barbier/d-i/l10n/xx and complete it. Don't
 forget to contact the original translator (see PO file header)

 Rename this file to xx.po and start working on it

-Getting 2nd stage files
 * base-config: the project is also hosted on alioth CVS server. Files
                are available on pages mentioned above
 * tasksel    : also hosted on alioth. Uses subversion
 * others     : use "apt-get source <package>" and report translations
                as normal bugs against the given packages 

How to translate
----------------
This document is not intended to be a tutorial for gettext-related
stuff. Please look for documentation of PO editing software such as
KBabel, gtranslator, PoEdit, EMacs PO-mode, etc.

Please use a dedicated PO-editing tool unless you become very familiar
with translation work.

Don't forget to properly fill up the PO files header, especially the
Last-Translator field. Fill the Project-Id-Version field with the
package name, that will help you in translation maintenance.

If a translation team exists for your language, WORK WITH THEM. First
check the debian-l10n-xxxxx mailing list where xxxxx is your language
name in english (e.g. debian-l10n-polish, debian-l10n-portuguese...).

For general translation issues or for finding other translators for
your language, you may also use the debian-i18n mailing list (don't
post translations there, however).

How to update existing translations
-----------------------------------

If you want to update a translation, please always contact the previous
translator in order to prevent duplication of work.  His mail address can
be found in the PO file.

How to test your work
---------------------

When you have finished your translation, always re-read your file at
least once to correct all meaning-, spelling-, grammar-, typo-, etc-
mistakes (maybe your po-editor does include a spellchecker or a
translation helper like acheck).  Running
  msgfmt --check --statistics <YOUR LANGUAGE CODE>.po
(from the gettext package) before committing is also a good idea to
check that your file is valid and will be integrated without trouble.

You may also use the Debian aspell package.

You could also run podebconf-display-po (from po-debconf >= 0.8.3)
on your file:
  podebconf-display-po -fdialog debian/po/<YOUR LANGUAGE CODE>.po
to have a rough idea on how your translation will look like.  But
as cdebconf and debconf displays slightly differ, and as some scripts
do heavy use of text substitution, do not fully rely on this program.
Running debian-installer is the only solution to test translations.

How to get help
---------------

If you need further assistance, feel free to ask for help on
debian-boot (for debian-installer related stuff) or debian-i18n (for
l10n related questions) Debian mailing lists.

How to get your work included in debian-installer
-------------------------------------------------

Choose either of the methods below. CVS commits are encouraged. Create
an alioth account and ask in -boot for getting write access.

 CVS commit
 ----------
If you have CVS write access, don't forget to update changelogs and
remember: changelog files use UTF-8!! The debian-installer CVS is hosted on
alioth.debian.org ("debian-installer" and "base-config" projects).

If the distribution in the first line of debian/changelog is
UNRELEASED, this means that it has been patched since the last upload.
In this case all you have to do is to add an entry at the end of this
revision.  Otherwise distribution is unstable, and you have then to
bump version number.  You can do it by hand, or by running dch -i but
in any case remember to replace unstable by UNRELEASED in the
distribution field.  Then add a comment about your contribution.

The standard form used to record a translation in debian/changelog is
as follows:

  * Translations:
    - Your Name Hess
      - Record here what you changed.

 File a bug
 ----------
You may send your translations as bug reports against the given
packages.  The packages names are the last part of the lines below
(for instance, "languagechooser" for tools/languagechooser).
Some packages have different names which are mentioned when needed.

For bug reports, please use the "d-i" and "l10n" tags.

 Send to debian-boot
 -------------------
You may also send the translations to the debian-boot mailing list.
Please use [INTL:xx] in Subjects where xx is your language code
(or xx_YY)

 Prospective packages
 --------------------
 
  partman/*
  
 Post-reboot installation stage
 ------------------------------

 (some of these packages do not only need debconf-type translation, but
 also program translation)

 Translations must be reported as wishlist bugs against these
 packages.  

 Base-config is an exception because it is maintained by the debian-boot
 team, so other methods (CVS commits and -boot filing) may apply for it.
 Note that it is a separate project on alioth.
  
 base-config (debconf)
 shadow (debconf+programs)
 console-data (debconf)
 discover (debconf)
 tasksel (debconf)
 aptitude (programs)
 dselect (programs) -> in dpkg source package
 apt (programs)
 dpkg (programs)
 exim4-config (debconf)
 passwd (debconf)
 popularity-contest (debconf)

 As 2nd stage install uses debconf, you also need to translate the
 interface widgets used by debconf. On mosts systems, the "dialog" interface
 is used, which require to translate widgets from the "newt" package.

 Once you have finished with this, you might want to consider proceeding based
 on the Package priority. This means that 'important' and 'standard' packages
 should be translated first. Since 'optional' and 'extra' priorities include
 quite a number of packages it is sensible to start working with common-used
 packages. The data from the 'popularity contest' is useful to decide
 what is commonly used (however, notice it might be biased).

 List of packages with debconf templates that should be translated first
 (as of this writing):

 Important
 ---------
 debconf man-db console-common netbase ifupdown console-data adduser
 setserial bsdmainutils lilo netkit-inetd

 Standard
 --------
 ssh wamerican libssl0.9.7 locales ibritish flex
 dictionaries-common iamerican

 Optional 
 --------
 (only some very commonly installed packages -first 30 in the list-
 are included here, ordered by popularity)
 apache-common tetex-bin xserver-common apache 
 libcupsys2 xserver-xfree86 ntpdate libfontconfig1 samba-common
 samba-common mozilla-browser libpaper1 fontconfig ntp-simple
 libpango1.0-common cvs xscreensaver screen powermgmt-base
 samba dash mysql-server gdm apt-listchanges libdiscover1
 discover libslp1 libnet-perl cupsys-client cupsys

APPENDIX
--------
 Countrychooser/iso-codes
 ------------------------

The countrychooser package uses country names and codes from the
iso-codes package. The country name translations are taken from this
package instead of just sitting in the countrychooser package.

For this reason, you need to translate the iso_3166.tab file in the
iso-codes package:
 - apt-get source iso-codes (from unstable)
 - cd iso-codes-<version>/iso_3166
 - "make iso_3166.pot"
 - copy templates.pot file to xx.po and translate country names there or complete
   the existing translation
 - send the new file as a bug report against the iso-codes package with
   the "l10n" and "patch" tag, severity wishlist

If a file already exists for your language, do the following:

 - "make iso_3166.pot"
 - msgmerge -U xx.po iso_3166.pot
 - update xx.po

The countrychooser package includes a mechanism for using an interim
translated file instead of iso-codes package translations. This allows
you to immediately test your translations. Just drop your file in
tools/countrychooser/iso-codes.updates and commit it. However, when
the upstream iso-codes package includes your translation, please
REMOVE the interim file from debian-installer CVS.

 kbd-chooser/console-data
 ------------------------

The kbd-chooser package uses keyboard names from the console-data package.
Thus, in order to get it completely translated, translators need to
translate console-data debconf templates.

First check on http://people.debian.org/~barbier/intl/l10n/po-debconf/<code>
(where <code> is your language code) if this file is already translated.

If it is not shown, then you may get the templates.pot file at:
http://people.debian.org/~barbier/intl/l10n/po-debconf/pot#console-data

Pick up the templates.pot file, modify it and send it back with a
bugreport to the package "console-data, with the "l10n" and "patch"
tag, severity wishlist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guide is supposed to be be a first start for translators.  There
are probably errors, and some packages we forgot.  Please add them if
you discover such packages, and fix it if you find errors.
