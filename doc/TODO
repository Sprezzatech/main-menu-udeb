Important things to do before preview release
=============================================
Following up on Anthony Town's mail "Chaos and Damnation!"
http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2003/debian-boot-200304/msg00067.html
Here's a list of urgent things we need to do before issuing a preview
release.

 * Unbreak netinst CDs
   - Decent order of menu items. It sucks to have the netcfg stuff appear
     above anna in the menu.

 * Finish partitioning/mkfs/mkswap/mount migration
   - Call mkfstab somewhere. base-installer?

 * Localization [Alastair McKinstry]
   - We need a proper fix for the newt frontend borders. TERM=xterm is too
     much of a hack! Yes this is a UTF-8 problem. (#187704, #189330)
   - We need a way to discover all/most of the glyphs needed by d-i.
   - We need find a way to load the missing glyphs into the linux
     kernel console. (#188147)

 * HW detection [Petter Reinholdtsen]

   - We need to start using module names from kernel 2.4 instead of 2.2
     The fix is to migrate hw-detect (ddetect) to discover2.  We are
     working with Jeff Licquia from Progeny to get this working.
     (#179048)

 * Editor
   - We need a working editor to be able to debug the installer. How do we
     fit it on the floppy image(s)?

 * Give base-installer a progress bar. Needs fixed progress bars.

 * Split off hostname configuration from netcfg.

 * Error handling.  We need to make sure the user is told so when
   something goes wrong.

Finished items:

 * Unbreak netinst CDs
   - Implement support in anna for installing different udebs for different
     installation scenarios. [Martin Sjögren, done]
   - File bugs on ftp.debian.org to clean up udeb priorities. [done]
   - Split the rootskel udeb in two, to make it possible to skip the
     UTF-8 locale on full floppies. [Petter Reinholdtsen, done]

 * cdebconf [Martin Sjögren]
   - Too long selection lists are cut short in the text frontend, and never
     show up in the newt frontend. This has to be fixed. Probably a buffer
     overflow somewhere. (#188043) [Sebastian Ley, done]
   - Fix the progress bars to play nicer with debootstrap. (#188243)
     [Martin Sjögren, done]
   - Fix the space mangling. (#185014) [Martin Sjögren, done]
   The last two items are backwards incompatible and will be done at the
   same time as libdebconf is dropped in favour of libdebconfclient. This
   needs a fixed mklibs that deals correctly with rpath information. [done]

 * Editor
   - Nano needs a slang udeb to work (bugs #177405, #186292).
     [Martin Sjögren, done]



The old TODO list, out of date (FIXME!)
=======================================

Where we are:

	We have a small chrooted system that is being autobuilt daily.
	A few installations have been accomplished using floppy+net and
	CD on i386.

General things to keep an eye on:

	- All udeb packages should be able to build debug versions if
	  DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="debug".
	- Udebs should not include .md5sum files.
	- Make sure all udebs declare dependencies on everything they
	  depend on (this includes depending on ash, busybox, etc). The
	  dependency web is pretty spotty right now.
        - Remember to run debconf-updatepo in package's debian/ dir after
          changing original text in English templates so the translations
          get updated and translators can do their work easier.
	- Keep this progress file up-to-date as you complete various parts 
	  of it.

Status for different parts of debian-installer.  The numbers are
approximate (as in +/- 50%) and may change in any direction, at any
time.

[0%]     - Not begun
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Some kind of a machanism for udebs to declare what parts of
	  busybox they need, so we can ensure that all deps are met while
	  keeping the busybox footprint small.
          Packages depending on base-installer should use the
	  utilities in /target so we can keep busybox's size down.          
	- polish everything so it is actually usable
	- translations
		(Waiting until there is i18n and final text to translate,
		and until we have figured out where the translations go.)
        - user documentation
		(Waiting until we have something to document..)
        - GUI frontend to cdebconf.  There has been talk about using
          gtk-fb as a frontend to cdebconf, but so far nobody has
          actually gotten anything working well.  [Michael Cardenas?]
          some people have talked about using Qtopia as well, but
          AFAIK, no work has been done there.

[30%]   - Might need large rewrites.  Current implementation might
          work by accident
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        - netcfg [David Whedon]
		Working, pending rewrite for IPv6 and multiple devices
                support.
        - busybox integration [Erik Andersen]
		TODO: seems we need touch, head, sort, and wc back on for
		debootstrap.
	- i18n [Denis Barbier, Tollef Fog Heen]
                Works in cdebconf, we need to make sure all templates
                are in UTF8 and make the frontends handle UTF8 in a
                sane way.
        - disk selector, partitioner [Raphael Hertzog, Raphael Hertzog]
		There are two of them, autopartkit and partkit.
		Autopartkit is a bit more advanced ATM.

[60%]   - Needs some work, but does its grunt work
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        - {lilo,grub} installer [Moshe Zadka, Tollef Fog Heen]
                moshez has a preliminary lilo-installer package in
                tools/lilo-installer, and a pre-preliminary grub-installer
                package in grub-installer.  lilo-installer seems to
                work.  grub-installer seems to work.
        - disk formatter
                Formats disks, turns on swap, etc.  mkfs is in udeb
                format, but nothing calls it.  swap is not begun.
        - base system installer [Anthony Towns, Tollef Fog Heen]
		debootstrap is stable, and has quite good support in
                base-installer
	- archive setup
                Mostly done, we probably want to separate testing and
                unstable at some point.
        - cdebconf [Randolph Chung]
                In progress, has multiple working database backends
                and one working text-based frontend, with progress on
                a slang frontend. Quite usable by now.
	- design [Joey Hess, debian-boot]
                80% done. Enough to know what the big pieces are 
                and how they fit together.
        - install media build system [David Whedon]
		We can build chrootable, library-reduced trees. It 
		boots too.  CD-ROM build system might some work.
	- dhcp [Matt Kraai]
		We're using dhclient, but should keep an eye on udhcpc,
		which is smaller.  We need to decide on one dhcp
                client.
         - floppy retriever [Martin Sjögren]
                Seems to work, at least for the time being.

[90%]  - Single missing important feature or bug.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- anna (retriever control program) [Martin Sjögren]
		Works, mostly.  Needs support for Releases files.
		Support for signed Release files would be cool, but
		needs gpgv-udeb.
        - main-menu (main menu generator) [Martin Sjögren, Joey Hess]
                - support for multiple provides are missing.
                - what happens when one step fails?
        - choose-mirror [Joey Hess]
		works, needs some polish and merging of ftp/http
                questions.

[100%] - Those shouldn't need to be touched any more 
         (except for wishlist features)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        - udpkg (tiny dpkg clone) [Randolph Chung, Joey Hess]
		May be replaced with busybox dpkg.
	- cd installs
                Works mostly.
	- kernel-package integration [Herbert Xu]
		Udebs are built automatically; this is well in hand.
 	- net retriever [Joey Hess]
		Seems to work.  FTP support missing.
	- cdrom retriever [Raphael Hertzog]
   		Working
        - ethdetect [David Whedon]
		Working
        - library reduction
		mklibs.py works, and is packaged, and used by the
                build process.
	- generate treecompare data for each daily build and put or mail it
	  somewhere [Joey Hess]
	  	http://people.debian.org/~joeyh/debian-installer/
	- post-reboot configuration [Joey Hess]
		base-cofig is stable, though stuff may need to be added to
		it to handle things d-i doesn't bother with.  i18n is
                needed.


Maybe, if somebody picks it up:
	- skinnable/themeable installer
