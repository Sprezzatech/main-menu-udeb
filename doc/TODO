Where we are:

	We have a small chrooted system that is being autobuilt daily.
	Ufortunatly, it is too big now. We're hoping to get this fixed
	by Wednesday.

General things to keep an eye on:

	- All udeb packages should be able to build debug versions if
	  DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="debug".
	- Udebs should not include .md5sum files.
	- Make sure all udebs declare dependancies on everything they
	  depend on (this includes depending on ash, busybox, etc). The
	  dependancy web is pretty spotty right now.
	- Keep this progress file up-to-date as you complete various parts 
	  of it.

Still Todo:

	- Some kind of a machanism for udebs to declare what parts of
	  busybox they need, so we can ensure that all deps are met while
	  keeping the busybox footprint small.
	- sort out Raphael's changes to rootskel and build/Makefile;
	  devices are made by both right now, and then devfs provides some
	  too. This all needs to be dealt with; rootskel shouldn't need to
	  make any devices, maybe it sets up symlinks though? And the
	  Makefile should not make any devices, for sure.
	- generate treecompare data for each daily build and put or mail it
	  somewhere [Joey Hess]
        - disk formatter
                Formats disks, turns on swap, etc.
	- debootstrap interface
        - {lilo,grub} installer
	- polish everything so it is actually usable
	- i18n
	- translations
		(Waiting until there is i18n and final text to translate,
		and until we have figured out where the translations go.)
        - user documentation
		(Waiting until we have something to document..)
	- cd installs, etc, etc, etc

Under development:

        - disk selector, partitioner [Raphael Hertzog, Raphael Hertzog]
		There are two of them, autopartkit and partkit.
		Autopartkit is a bit more advanced ATM.
        - cdebconf [Randolph Chung]
                In progress, has one working database backend and one
		working text-based frontend, with progress on a slang
		frontend. Quite usable by now.
        - ethdetect [David Whedon]
		Current status?
        - netcfg [David Whedon]
		Current status?
	- dhcp [Matt Kraai]
		We're using dhclient, but should keep an eye on udhcpc,
		which is smaller.
	- anna (retreiver control program) [Joey Hess, Glenn McGrath]
		About 10% done realistically, but it does work.
        - choose-mirror [Joey Hess]
		80% done
        - base system installer [Anthony Towns]
		debootstrap is stable, but needs to be integrated into d-i;
		udebs are not available yet.
        - library reduction
		mklibs.sh works, but it is not packaged. This is a pain in
		the ass.
        - install media build system [Joey Hess, David Whedon]
		We can build chrootable, library-reduced trees. It 
		boots too (CHECK: does it still?). Dns does not work though.

More or less done, for now anyway:

	- design [Joey Hess, debian-boot]
                80% done. Enough to know what the big peices are 
                and how they fit together.
        - udpkg (tiny dpkg clone) [Randolph Chung, Joey Hess]
		Usable. One todo item (localized descriptions)
		May be replaced with busybox dpkg.
        - main-menu (main menu generator) [Joey Hess]
                90% done (one non-trivial todo item)
        - busybox integration [Erik Andersen]
		TODO: seems we need touch, head, sort, and wc back on for
		debootstrap.
	- kernel-package integration [Herbert Xu]
		Udebs are built automatically; this is well in hand.
 	- wget retriever [Joey Hess]
		Needs proxy and general testing.  Will soon have
		ftp support.
	- cdrom retriever [Raphael Hertzog]
		I guess it works.
	- archive setup
		Done.
	- post-reboot configuration [Joey Hess]
		base-cofig is stable, though stuff may need to be added to
		it to handle things d-i doesn't bother with
