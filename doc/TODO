Where we are:

	We have a small chrooted system that is being autobuilt daily.
	A few installations have been accomplished using floppy+net and
	CD on i386.

General things to keep an eye on:

	- All udeb packages should be able to build debug versions if
	  DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="debug".
	- Udebs should not include .md5sum files.
	- Make sure all udebs declare dependancies on everything they
	  depend on (this includes depending on ash, busybox, etc). The
	  dependancy web is pretty spotty right now.
	- Keep this progress file up-to-date as you complete various parts 
	  of it.

Status for different parts of debian-installer.  The numbers are
approximate (as in +/- 50%) and may change in any direction, at any
time.

[0%]     - Not begun
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Some kind of a machanism for udebs to declare what parts of
	  busybox they need, so we can ensure that all deps are met while
	  keeping the busybox footprint small.
          Packages depending on base-installer should use the
	  utilities in /target so we can keep busybox's size down.          
	- polish everything so it is actually usable
	- translations
		(Waiting until there is i18n and final text to translate,
		and until we have figured out where the translations go.)
        - user documentation
		(Waiting until we have something to document..)
        - GUI frontend to cdebconf.  There has been talk about using
          gtk-fb as a frontend to cdebconf, but so far nobody has
          actually gotten anything working well.  [Michael Cardenas?]
          some people have talked about using Qtopia as well, but
          AFAIK, no work has been done there.

[30%]   - Might need large rewrites.  Current implementation might
          work by accident
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        - netcfg [David Whedon]
		Working, pending rewrite for IPv6 and multiple devices
                support.
        - busybox integration [Erik Andersen]
		TODO: seems we need touch, head, sort, and wc back on for
		debootstrap.
	- i18n [Denis Barbier, Tollef Fog Heen]
                Works in cdebconf, we need to make sure all templates
                are in UTF8 and make the frontends handle UTF8 in a
                sane way.
        - disk selector, partitioner [Raphael Hertzog, Raphael Hertzog]
		There are two of them, autopartkit and partkit.
		Autopartkit is a bit more advanced ATM.

[60%]   - Needs some work, but does its grunt work
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        - {lilo,grub} installer [Moshe Zadka, Tollef Fog Heen]
                moshez has a preliminary lilo-installer package in
                tools/lilo-installer, and a pre-preliminary grub-installer
                package in grub-installer.  lilo-installer seems to
                work.  grub-installer seems to work.
        - disk formatter
                Formats disks, turns on swap, etc.  mkfs is in udeb
                format, but nothing calls it.  swap is not begun.
        - base system installer [Anthony Towns, Tollef Fog Heen]
		debootstrap is stable, and has quite good support in
                base-installer
	- archive setup
                Mostly done, we probably want to separate testing and
                unstable at some point.
        - cdebconf [Randolph Chung]
                In progress, has multiple working database backends
                and one working text-based frontend, with progress on
                a slang frontend. Quite usable by now.
	- design [Joey Hess, debian-boot]
                80% done. Enough to know what the big pieces are 
                and how they fit together.
        - install media build system [David Whedon]
		We can build chrootable, library-reduced trees. It 
		boots too.  CD-ROM build system might some work.
	- dhcp [Matt Kraai]
		We're using dhclient, but should keep an eye on udhcpc,
		which is smaller.  We need to decide on one dhcp
                client.
         - floppy retriever [Martin Sjögren]
                Seems to work, at least for the time being.

[90%]  - Single missing important feature or bug.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	- anna (retreiver control program) [Martin Sjögren]
		Works, mostly.  Needs support for Releases files.
		Support for signed Release files would be cool, but
		needs gpgv-udeb.
        - main-menu (main menu generator) [Martin Sjögren, Joey Hess]
                - support for multiple provides are missing.
                - what happens when one step fails?
        - choose-mirror [Joey Hess]
		works, needs some polish and merging of ftp/http
                questions.

[100%] - Those shouldn't need to be touched any more 
         (except for wishlist features)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        - udpkg (tiny dpkg clone) [Randolph Chung, Joey Hess]
		May be replaced with busybox dpkg.
	- cd installs
                Works mostly.
	- kernel-package integration [Herbert Xu]
		Udebs are built automatically; this is well in hand.
 	- net retriever [Joey Hess]
		Seems to work.  FTP support missing.
	- cdrom retriever [Raphael Hertzog]
   		Working
        - ethdetect [David Whedon]
		Working
        - library reduction
		mklibs.py works, and is packaged, and used by the
                build process.
	- generate treecompare data for each daily build and put or mail it
	  somewhere [Joey Hess]
	  	http://people.debian.org/~joeyh/debian-installer/
	- post-reboot configuration [Joey Hess]
		base-cofig is stable, though stuff may need to be added to
		it to handle things d-i doesn't bother with.  i18n is
                needed.


Maybe, if somebody picks it up:
	- skinnable/themeable installer
