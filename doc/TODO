	 - design [Joey Hess, debian-boot]
                75% done. Enough to know what the big peices are 
                and how they fit together.
		- The main menu design has some issues. If a step is failing
		  because some step above it did something wrong, but thought it
		  succeeded (a disk was partitioned, but very badly, and installing
		  the base system to it fails), there is no way to force the user
		  to back up. This seems to preclude linear install mode. I posted
		  a longer example to -boot. Three possible fixes:
		  	- Detect loops, and have code to figure out what went wrong
			  and back up to the appropriate step that can fix it
			- Detect loops, and back up to the beginning of the menu
			- Detect whenever any menu item fails, and leave linear
			  mode. (BEST)
		- Need to define module subsystems for network/hardware support,
		  network configuration, target media support, etc.
        - udeb archive setup [James Troup, Anthony Towns, Jason Gunthorpe]
                95% support in new package pools code. That code will
		go live soon after Debian 2.2r1 is released.
        - udeb building [Joey Hess, Wichert Akkerman]
                99% done. udebs can be built, but a 2 line patch to
                dpkg-genchanges is required. A new version of dpkg-dev
                was promised for last weekend.
        - cdebconf (miniature debconf in C) [Randolph Chung, Anthony Towns]
                In progress. Infrastructure is 70% done. have one working
                (sick) database backend, have a conceptual text-based
                frontend that is ~1/4 done.
        - udpkg (tiny dpkg clone) [Randolph Chung, Joey Hess]
                Usable. Can install packages and update the status file,
                though there is one known bug related to that. Needs to
                support Pre-Depends and localized descriptions. --unpack
                and --configure code needs testing.
        - main-menu (main menu generator) [Joey Hess]
                90% done (one non-trivial todo item).
        - busybox integration [Erik Andersen]
                Not started. Busybox needs to build one or more .udebs.
                Probably more than one.
        - network card detector [UNCLAIMED]
                Not started. Detect the NIC in a computer by safe autoprobing,
                and by prompting otherwise.
        - network setup [UNCLAIMED]
                Not started. Set up the network, via dhcp or via prompting;
                implementor decides.
        - retreiver control program [UNCLAIMED]
                Not started. Sort of like apt, except tons dumber, this
                uses retreiver(s) to download Packages files and then udebs,
                and calls udpkg to install them.
        - http retreiver [UNCLAMED]
                Not started. Download udebs, other files from network.
        - install target media detector [UNCLAIMED]
                Not started. Just has to figure out what media to install to.
                Probably trivial; most support already in the kernel.
        - disk partitioner [UNCLAIMED]
                Not started. Some kind of a UI to let the user partition their
                disks and decide what the partitions are used for.
        - disk formatter [UNCLAIMED]
                Not started. Formats disks, turns on swap, etc.
        - base system installer [UNCLAIMED]
                Not started. Installs the base system, probably from base.tgz
                for now, and does any necessary setup.
        - {lilo,grub} installer [UNCLAIMED]
                Not started. Sets up {lilo,grub}.
        - kernel module udebs [UNCLAIMED]
                Not started. We will need various sets of kernel modules;
                one such set is NIC drivers. Each set goes in a udeb; there
                probably has to be a system to build the whole kernel and
                udebs.
        - library reduction [UNCLAIMED]
                Not started. There is code in the boot-floppies that may
                be usable, but this is one of the hardest parts.
        - install media build system [UNCLAIMED]
                Not started. Puts all the peices together and makes
                install media.
        - documentation [UNCLAIMED}
	                Not started.
