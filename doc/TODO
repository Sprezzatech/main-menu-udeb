Where we are:

	We have a small chrooted system that is being autobuilt daily.

	Now it is time to begin working on making it actually boot. The
	other thing that really needs work is the partitioner.

General things to keep an eye on:

	- All udeb packages should be able to build debug versions if
	  DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="debug".
	- Packages that link in cdebconf should build-depend on
	  cdebconf-dev now that it is in Debian.
	- Make sure all udebs declare dependancies on everything they
	  depend on (this includes depending on ash, busybox, etc). The
	  dependancy web is pretty spotty right now.
	- Keep this progress file up-to-date as you complete various parts 
	  of it.

Still Todo:

        - target media detector
                Just has to figure out what media to install to.
                Probably trivial; most support already in the kernel.
        - disk partitioner
                Some kind of a UI to let the user partition their
                disks and decide what the partitions are used for.
        - disk formatter
                Formats disks, turns on swap, etc.
	- polish everything so it is actually usable
	- i18n
	- translations
		(Waiting until there is i18n and final text to translate..)
        - user documentation
		(Waiting until we have something to document..)
	- cd installs, etc, etc, etc

Under development:

        - cdebconf (miniature debconf in C) [Randolph Chung, Anthony Towns]
                In progress, has one working database backend and one
		working text-based frontend, with progress on a slang
		frontend. Quite usable by now.
        - ethdetect [David Whedon]
		Seems to work, still needs some itegration into the chroot.
	- insmod/modprobe [David Whedon]
		Udebs not yet available, patch sent to bts.
        - netcfg [David Whedon]
		Development in progress, and partly works now.
        - anna (retreiver control program) [Joey Hess, Glenn McGrath]
		About 10% done realistically, but it does work.
        - choose-mirror [Joey Hess]
		80% done
        - base system installer [Anthony Towns]
		Aj has a script that bootstraps a chrooted base system
		starting with just busybox. It needs integration into the
		system, and udebs are not available yet.
        - {lilo,grub} installer [Gergely Risko]
		Debconfized lilo is in debian.
        - kernel-image-di [Joey Hess]
		Builds both a regular kernel-image package and udebs for
		the modules. Still needs work. Kenrel config file needs 
		work expecially, as do the selections of exactly which
		modules go in which udebs.
        - library reduction [Marcus Brinkmann]
		mklibs.sh works, but it is not packaged.
        - install media build system [Joey Hess, David Whedon]
		We can build chrootable, library-reduced trees. It almost
		boots too.
	- post-reboot configuration [Joey Hess?]
		Many packages that are currently set up by the
		boot-floppies need to start handling their own setup, after
		reboot, via debconf. These include timezone and clock config, 
		many of the things in base-config now, what else?

Needs testing:
	- netkit-tiny [David Whedon]
		Packaged, not really tested.
	- other hardware detection [David Whedon]
		David has written detectors for sound, ethernet, cd, cpu,
		disk, and memory detection. All need testing.
	- system as a whole

More or less done, for now anyway:

	- design [Joey Hess, debian-boot]
                80% done. Enough to know what the big peices are 
                and how they fit together.
        - udpkg (tiny dpkg clone) [Randolph Chung, Joey Hess]
		Usable. One todo item (localized descriptions)
        - main-menu (main menu generator) [Joey Hess]
                90% done (one non-trivial todo item)
        - busybox integration [Erik Andersen]
		First pass busybox udeb available.
 	- http retriever [Joey Hess]
		Works, needs testing and proxy support.
	- archive setup
		Done.
