Where we are:

	We have a small chrooted system that is being autobuilt daily.
	Ufortunatly, it is about 233k too big now. We're hoping to get this
	fixed by Wednesday.

General things to keep an eye on:

	- All udeb packages should be able to build debug versions if
	  DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="debug".
	- Udebs should not include .md5sum files.
	- Make sure all udebs declare dependancies on everything they
	  depend on (this includes depending on ash, busybox, etc). The
	  dependancy web is pretty spotty right now.
	- Keep this progress file up-to-date as you complete various parts 
	  of it.

Still Todo:

	- generate treecompare data for each daily build and put or mail it
	  somewhere [Joey Hess]
	- re-orient and get back on our feet after the long hiatus:
		- daily autobuilds are happening again
		- TODO: scan and summarize all changes since last spring

        - target media detector
                Just has to figure out what media to install to.
                Probably trivial; most support already in the kernel.
        - disk formatter
                Formats disks, turns on swap, etc.
        - {lilo,grub} installer
	- polish everything so it is actually usable
	- i18n
	- translations
		(Waiting until there is i18n and final text to translate..)
        - user documentation
		(Waiting until we have something to document..)
	- cd installs, etc, etc, etc

Under development:

        - disk partitioner [David Whedon]
		tools/partkit in CVS. Currently doesn't do much
		but is a good start.
        - cdebconf [Randolph Chung]
                In progress, has one working database backend and one
		working text-based frontend, with progress on a slang
		frontend. Quite usable by now.
        - ethdetect [David Whedon]
		Seems to work, still needs some itegration into the chroot.
        - netcfg [David Whedon]
		Development in progress, and partly works now.
		some required patches (dhcp) still in bts.
	- anna (retreiver control program) [Joey Hess, Glenn McGrath]
		About 10% done realistically, but it does work.
        - choose-mirror [Joey Hess]
		80% done
        - base system installer [Anthony Towns]
		debootstrap is stable, but needs to be integrated into d-i
		udebs are not available yet.
        - library reduction
		mklibs.sh works, but it is not packaged. This is a pain in
		the ass.
        - install media build system [Joey Hess, David Whedon]
		We can build chrootable, library-reduced trees. It 
		boots too (CHECK: does it still?). Dns does not work though.

Needs testing:

	- netkit-tiny [David Whedon]
		Packaged, not really tested.
	- other hardware detection [David Whedon]
		David has written detectors for sound, ethernet, cd, cpu,
		disk, and memory detection. All need testing.
	- system as a whole

More or less done, for now anyway:

	- design [Joey Hess, debian-boot]
                80% done. Enough to know what the big peices are 
                and how they fit together.
        - udpkg (tiny dpkg clone) [Randolph Chung, Joey Hess]
		Usable. One todo item (localized descriptions)
		May be replaced with busybox dpkg.
        - main-menu (main menu generator) [Joey Hess]
                90% done (one non-trivial todo item)
        - busybox integration [Erik Andersen]
		First pass busybox udeb available.
	- kernel-package integration [Herbert Xu]
		Udebs are built automatically; this is well in hand.
 	- wget retriever [Joey Hess]
		Needs proxy and general testing.  Will soon have
		ftp support.
	- archive setup
		Done.
	- post-reboot configuration [Joey Hess]
		base-cofig is stable, though stuff may need to be added to
		it to handle things d-i doesn't bother with
