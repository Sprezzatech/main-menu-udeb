This is a very rough start at a new Debian installation system.

Resources: libdetect -- find devices and tell which modules to load

Random ideas:
	Mandrake has an interesting replication feature. After install you
	can ask it to make a floppy that can be used to replicate the
	install you just did. All the data you entered it stored on it.
