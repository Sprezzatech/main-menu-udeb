This is a very rough start at a new Debian installation system.

Random ideas:

  Mandrake has an interesting replication feature.  After install you
  can ask it to make a floppy that can be used to replicate the
  install you just did.  All the data you entered is stored on it.

  Caldera's "Lizard" (on their 2000 tech preview w/kernel 2.4) will
  begin installing packages off the CD-ROM in the background while you
  continue answering configuration questions.  They have a very nice
  Majong game at the end also.

  Upx can compress bzimages. They're still bootable, and up to 100k might
  be saved this way. http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/upx.html
