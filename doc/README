This is a very rough start at a new Debian installation system.

See ../build/README for build instructions.

Random ideas:

  Mandrake has an interesting replication feature.  After install you
  can ask it to make a floppy that can be used to replicate the
  install you just did.  All the data you entered is stored on it.
  Should be easy enough to do if we stick the debconf database on a
  rescue floppy in /var/lib/cdebconf

  This link was posted on the list concerning automated installs:

  Caldera's "Lizard" (on their 2000 tech preview w/kernel 2.4) will
  begin installing packages off the CD-ROM in the background while you
  continue answering configuration questions.  They have a very nice
  Majong game at the end also.

  Upx can compress bzimages. They're still bootable, and up to 100k might
  be saved this way. http://upx.sourceforge.net/
