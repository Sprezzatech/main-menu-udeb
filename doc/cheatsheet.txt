Random things to remember (please add to this list)

- When changing in debconf templates, remember to run debconf2po-update so
  the files in the po directory will be updated.

- Releases are tagged as in cvs-buildpackage, that is
  debian_version_0_0_1 for version 0.0.1.

- Make sure you don't include md5sums inside the package.
