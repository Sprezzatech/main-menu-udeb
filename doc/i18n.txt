This file describes how we want internationalization to work for the
installation system. (debian-installer and base-config)

FIXME: this is currently one big mess and it needs to be turned into a short
info and a TODO list. Hopefully I'll fix it tommorow...

Since most questions will be asked via some debconf implementation, most of
the messages we need to localize will be the templates files. Each udeb will
contain the messages that will be used by it.

Moreover, we only need to fit on floppy the messages that will be used by
udebs which initially reside (unpacked) on the floppy. This is as little as
5.7 KB (uncompressed!) per language (says Tollef Fog Heen, 11.09.2002).
Additional udebs which will be retrieved by the installer from the cdrom or
network will contain their messages, but this is not a big problem, since the
ramdisk will be larger then the floppy image.

That way there will not be a large messages file for each language, which are
difficult to fit on a floppy (like there was in boot-floppies).

Because of that there won't be a need to retrieve a separate "language udeb",
and all languages will fit on the standard flopy.

A rough roadmap:

 - for udebs, we:
   * make the templates.ll files in whatever encoding we like
   * recode (say using iconv) the templates.ll to UTF-8 when creating
     the "combined" templates file
   * simply copy the strings read from templates (now in UTF-8) to
     output at run time. That way cdebconf doesn't need huge conversion tables.
   * only run cdebconf (and thus whole debian-installer) in bterm [1]

 - for debs (base system), we:
   * make the templates.ll files in whatever encoding
   * recode them when concatening (e.g. by using po-debconf)
   * use iconv at run time in debconf - see the script in
     http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=148490&repeatmerged=yes
     [2]

1. Is this possible on all architectures? I mean: do all architectures
   use framebuffer?
   That also means that bterm will be "Essential" in debian-installer,
   since we won't be able to output any localized text without it.

Philip Blundell: bogl just needs to have support for the appropriate display
types added

2. That will make debconf depend on libtext-iconv-perl, though and
   force its inclusion into base system.
   joeyh says that we need to turn that dependancy into "Recommends:" or
   suggests.
   Also packages that will want proper recoding (epecially important if user's
   locale doesn't match the template's translator's locale), will need to
   provide templates in utf-8 (i.e. use po-debconf).

ISSUES:

* Some developers keep all translations in a single templates file,
  see 'adduser' for instance.

* i18n of messages and other things require setlocale.
  AFAIK there are no call to setlocale in the sources.
  Adding

    setlocale(LC_ALL,"");
 
  to start of each main() should be enough.

* main-menu asks debconf for debian-installer/language which afaict
  doesn't exist. IMO it would be better if the thing that asked for
  debian-installer/language first, sets LANG=$language after that, so setlocale
  can be used.

I would like to rename the debconf answer from
debian-installer/language to debian-installer/locale, and store a real
locale name (ll_CC) there.  This way, we can actually use LANG=$locale
after generating the required locale data file.  We can also pass the
content in /target/root/dbootstrap_settings as LANG_INST=$locale to
tell base-config which language to use.

I would also like to add support for the LANGUAGE style variable
listing several languages in priority order to be able to use other
translations if the primary translation is missing.  I want it to be
able to tell the system to use Norwegian Bokm?l if present, and if it
isn't use Norwegian Nynorsk, Danish and as a last resort Swedish.
This way non-english speakers in Norway have a good chance of
understanding the installation.

* The Packages file parsing didn't support Description-ll_CC, only
  Description-ll (something I'm working on fixing) and I'm not sure about
  cdebconf as I get lost in the source code when I try to have a look.

* Not all templates are in UTF-8.

* No templates should be in UTF-8.
  They need to be converted from their local encoding to
  the UTF-8 on the fly, or on creation of udebs.

  Reason: difficulties with editing

* debconf TITLE commands aren't translated at all.


[ The following two probably are non-issues now sice thanks to modularity we ]
[ can fit all messages on the floppy                                         ]


* Should we even use debconf i18n (which is pretty limited) or po files
  as per gettext?

* How much i18n can we (and how much do we want to) fit on the floppy?

  That is why udebootstrap may be required.
  Note that debian-installer goes very far back from boot-floppies in respect
  to i18n.
  boot-floppies worked around the size constraints by loading locale
  information from file on CD-Rom, if it was available.  (xlp.tgz).
