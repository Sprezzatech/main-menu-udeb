Using bogl-bterm with debian-installer
======================================

The status as of 2003-03-16 is the following:

* bogl-bterm doesn't support devfs. I have a simple, stupid patch[0] that
  doesn't work with non-devfs.

* We need udebs of bogl-bterm and fbset. In the meantime, I just use the
  full-size debs and trim out stuff manually (eew).

* build/Makefile must generate a reduced font. I have a patch[1] for that
  too. You also need graphic.utf[2] from b-f. You need bf-utf-source
  (for the full font) and libbogl-dev (for reduce-font and bdftobogl)

* rootskel has to modprobe for the framebuffer modules, run fbset and
  start things through bogl-bterm. I of course have a patch[3] for that too.
