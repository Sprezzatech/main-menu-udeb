partman-lvm (1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Took partman-palo and s/palo/lvm/.
  * The method `lvm' is available only if parted_server reports that the
    flag `lvm' is valid.
  * templates: add translatable names of lvm.
  * init.d/lvm: discover activated logical volumes and automaticaly create
    loop partition table and a partition in them.
  * add menu-item to the main menu to configure LVM.
