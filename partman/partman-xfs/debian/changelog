partman-xfs (1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Translations:
      - DO NOT update changelog anymore for translations. This will be done
        by using scripts/l10n-changes script
      - When releasing the package, don't forget to run
        script/l10n-changes/output-l10n-changes and put its
        output here. Then put this note in the new UNRELEASED entry.
 
  * Took partman-ext3 and s/ext3/xfs/, essentially. Closes: #235368
  * Call mkfs.xfs with -f.
  * Add a no_xfs_boot finish.d script which checks to make sure that /boot
    is not on an XFS filesystem, as this causes mysterious grub-install
    hangs. If it is, the user is shown a warning, and can go back and fix it.
