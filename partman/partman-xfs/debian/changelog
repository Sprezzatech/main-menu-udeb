partman-xfs (3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Anton Zinoviev
    - add sync after creation of file system.  (At least for swap spaces
      this is necessary, not sure for the others.) 
    - enable the swap during file system creation.

partman-xfs (1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Took partman-ext3 and s/ext3/xfs/, essentially. Closes: #235368
  * Call mkfs.xfs with -f.
  * Add a no_xfs_boot finish.d script which checks to make sure that /boot
    is not on an XFS filesystem, as this causes mysterious grub-install
    hangs. If it is, the user is shown a warning, and can go back and fix it.
