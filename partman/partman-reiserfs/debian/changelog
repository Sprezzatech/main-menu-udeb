partman-reiserfs (1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Translations:
      - DO NOT update changelog anymore for translations. This will be done
        by using scripts/l10n-changes script
      - When releasing the package, don't forget to run
        script/l10n-changes/output-l10n-changes and put its
        output here. Then put this note in the new UNRELEASED entry.
	
  * Joey Hess
    - Took partman-xfs and s/xfs/reiserfs/, essentially. Closes: #236202
    - Call mkfs.reiserfs with -f -q.
  * Anton Zinoviev
    - format_reiserfs: add commented code to format by parted
    - remove check_reiserfs
    - do not add 'errors=remount-ro' option for /
    - mount.d/reiserfs: preserve the option notail when mounting
    - templates: s/reiserfs/ReiserFS/ in some places.
    - templates (partman-reiserfs/options): added option "notail".  Should
      the other options be removed?
