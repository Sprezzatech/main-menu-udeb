_Description: Specify mount options

Template: partman-ext3/options
Type: multiselect
Choices: noatime, nodev, nosuid, noexec, ro, sync, usrquota, grpquota
_Descriptions: Mount options:
 You may choose one or more mounting options among the following:
 .
 noatime -- do not update inode access times for each access.  This
 option is e.g. useful for fast access to news spools.  It is
 recommended for file systems on Compact Flash cards, USB Flash Drive
 and similar devices as they break down after too many writes.
 .
 nodev -- do not interpret character or block special devices.  On
 hardened secure hosts this option should be used for all file systems
 that contain directories where regular users have write access
 (/home, /tmp, /var/tmp, etc.).  Do not use this option for the
 root file system.
 .
 nosuid -- ignore set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
 bits (this is not safe if you have suidperl installed).
 .
 noexec -- do not allow execution of any binaries.
 .
 ro -- mount the file system read-only.
 .
 sync -- all input/output activities occur synchronously on the file system;
 .
 usrquota / grpquota -- user/group disk quota accounting enabled, and
 limits (optionally) enforced.
