partman (2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merged with partman-parted.
  * Uses init.d, undo.d and commit.d.
  * The device directory is /var/lib/partman/devices rather than somewhere
    in /tmp.
  * Each device has it own partition directory which contains only
    information from name.d.
  * parted_devices is in /bin.  Returns bytes rather than human size.
    server is renamed to parted_server and is also in /bin.
  * Renamings of the files in the device-directories: parted_name->device,
    device_name->model, size contains blocks rather than human size.  name
    is removed.
  * The creation of new label is moved in partman-partitioning.
