_Description: Specify mount options

Template: partman-basicfilesystems/options
Type: multiselect
Choices: noatime, nodev, nosuid, noexec, ro, sync, usrquota, grpquota
_Descriptions: Please specify the mount options
 This is the meaning of the options:
 .
 noatime -- do not update inode access times for each access.  This
 option is usefull e.g. for fast access to the news spool.  It is
 recommended for file systems on Compact Flash cards, USB Flash Drive
 and similar devices as they break down after too many writes.
 .
 nodev -- do not interpret character or block special devices.  On
 hardened secure hosts this option should be used for all file systems
 that contain directories where regular users have write access
 (/home, /tmp, /var/tmp, etc.).  Ofcource it may not be used for the
 root file system.
 .
 nosuid -- do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier
 bits to take effect.  (This is not safe if you have suidperl
 installed.)
 .
 noexec -- do not allow execution of any binaries.
 .
 ro -- mount the file system read-only.
 .
 sync -- do synchronously all I/O to the file system.
 .
 usrquota / grpquota -- user/group disk quota accounting enabled, and
 limits (optionally) enforced.

Template: partman-basicfilesystems/fatoptions
Type: multiselect
Choices: ro, sync, quiet
_Descriptions: Please specify the mount options
 This is the meaning of the options:
 .
 ro -- mount the file system read-only.
 .
 sync -- do synchronously all I/O to the file system.
 .
 quiet -- attempts to chown and chmod files do not return errors,
 although they fail.  Usefull but use with caution.
