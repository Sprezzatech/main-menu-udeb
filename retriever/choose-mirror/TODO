* If ftp or http isn't turned on, we can trim down the templates file..
  Or, if cdebconf supports registration, I could just collapse the mor eor
  less duplicate ftp and http templates into one, and register multiple
  questions from it. Which is probably best..
* What about picking the distribution to use? Seems silly to have that on
  the final installer, but before release it needs to know to use
  unstable/testing/frozen rather than stable. Maybe a really low-priority
  question? Currently, the distribution name is hardcoded in
  wget-retriever..
