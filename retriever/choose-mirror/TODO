* Finish it :-) And test it. :-)
* choose-mirror really needs to work like this: you pass it a parameter,
  which choses http/ftp/whatever. It goes and does its thing for that
  type of mirror. Then I can build a http-only version, maybe a ftp-only
  version, and a combined version. Only one will be installed on a given 
  install media; if it just has http, the http only one will be used, if it
  has http and ftp, the big one will be used, etc. (Don't need to do all
  the permutations...) This will, of course, require some internal
  reworking.
