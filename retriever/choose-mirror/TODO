* It should really support ftp too. And makeheader.pl does, I just need some
  way to parameteraize which set of data choose-mirror.c uses.
* What about picking the distribution to use? Seems silly to have that on
  the final installer, but before release it needs to know to use
  unstable/frozen rather than stable. Maybe a really low-priority question?
* What about validating input by trying to connect to the mirror? Or is
  that the retriever's job?
