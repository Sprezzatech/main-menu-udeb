Description: run a live demo of the Debian Installer, without rebooting
 This package allows you to run a demonstration version of the Debian
 installer in a chroot on a Debian system. While it might be possible to
 use the demo system to actually install Debian to a spare partition, there
 are better (and safer!) ways than using this Debian system, such as 
 debootstrap. However, this package is useful if you'd like a look at the
 Debian installer, or want to test or debug some aspect of it.
