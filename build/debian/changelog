  * Goswin von Brederlow
    - Moved fetching of (u)debs into get-packages shell script.
    - Changed sources.list to sources.list.udeb, added sources.list.deb.
    - Allowed "deb file:/..." urls in /etc/apt/sources.list,
      simplified sed expression and change file to copy urls.
    - Add explaining error message when apt-get update fails
    - get-packages: Only seed dpkg status with libs when getting udebs
    - pkg-lists/cdrom/alpha: missing input-modules-${kernel:Version}
    - pkg-lists/mirror_udeb: lists for a partial mirror suitable for the CDs
    - Drop pump-udeb (netboot on alpha, s390 and sparc) in favour of
      dhcp-client-udeb
    - debain/control: added Build-Depends: mkisofs
    - daily-build: changed to copy last days images and rsync new ones
    - daily-build: don't let the builder wait for logs, use tee
  * Joey Hess
    - Switch i386 to using dhcp-client rather than pump for netboot.
      Left it using pump on other arches that did not already use dhcp-client,
      at least for now.
    - Switch i386, hppa, and ia64 to dhcp-client rather than udhcp
      on the root floppy.
    - Switch powerpc to pump on the root floppy.
    - Switch i386 to dhcp-client rather than udhcp on the access floppy.
    - Switch from pump to dhcp-client on powerpc.
    - Add disk labels to the i386 floppy images, for use by the bootfloppy
      initrd, and maybe later by the floppy retreiver, etc.
  * Thiemo Seufer
    - Fix error handling in tftpboot.sh
  * Chris Tillman
    - Add DEBCONF_PRIORITY note to powerpc boot message.
    - Add MacRISC3 & 4 to ofboot.b for compatibility with G4/G5 powerpcs

debian-installer (20031113) unstable; urgency=low

  * Joey Hess
    - Add new loop-modules to bootfloppy, hd-media.
    - Move input-modules from root floppy to bootfloppy, as the new
      rootskel-bootfloppy prompts for the user to hit enter.
    - Remove redundant usb-discover and usb-modules from root floppy;
      the boot floppy takes care of that.
    - Remove fat-modules and floppy-modules from the root floppy; they
      boot floppy loads them.
    - Create DEST before copying in DEST_KERNEL.
    - ia64 build-depends on dosfstools. Closes: #219919
    - sparc build-depends on genromfs. Closes: #220208
    - remove brltty from everything except access. It is causing problems
      (#219928) on sparc at least.
    - add nic-extra-modules to netboot for i386, as it fits and netboot
      should support as much as it can
    - try to get full UTF-8 going on netboot
    - add nano to netboot
  * Richard Hirst
    - Add mtools as a build-dep for ia64

      available.

debian-installer (20031029) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * This includes a deb that lets a demo of the installer be run
    (and triggers autobuilders), but the main payload is the
    debian-installer-images tarball, which is designed to be unpacked
    by ftp-master into the ftp site.
  * Set architecture to i386, powerpc for now. More will be added
    once d-i works on them well enough to distribute images.
