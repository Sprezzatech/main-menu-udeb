debian-installer (20031029) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * This includes a deb that lets a demo of the installer be run
    (and triggers autobuilders), but the main payload is the
    debian-installer-images tarball, which is designed to be unpacked
    by ftp-master into the ftp site.
  * Set architecture to i386, powerpc for now. More will be added
    once d-i works on them well enough to distribute images.
