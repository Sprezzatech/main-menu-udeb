This directory should contain, for each language supported in Debian
Installer, one file, named after the language ISO_639 code (fr for
French, de for German and so on).

This file should contain all non ASCII characters used for the language
in the installer. In general you can list all charcters, but if you know
the installer will never have a message containing a given character (such
as the Euro sign), please leave it out to save space.

Please include ALL needed characters (see "fr" file as example) even if they
are already included in another file for another language.

The file MUST be UTF-8 encoded.

At the moment this file is written, this is needed for latin languages.
Whether or not, non-latin languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Arabic,
Hebrew, Russian, Ukrainian, etc. need or not this file is to be determined.
In general, if your language uses hundreds or thousands of characters, this
file is the wrong approach, and you should instead look at the
bterm-unifont udeb.

These files (plus the templates files for everything on the initrd) will be
used for building the reduced font that goes onto the initrd images. This
font needs to be as tiny as possible but needs to support all necessary
languages characters.
