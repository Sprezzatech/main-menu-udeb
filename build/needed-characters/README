This directory should contain, for each language supported in Debian
Installer, one file, named after the language ISO_639 code (fr for
French, de for German and so on).

This file should contain all non ASCII characters needed for properly
write the given language.

Please include ALL needed characters (see "fr" file as example) even if they
are already included in another file for another language.

The file MUST be UTF-8 encoded.

At the moment this file is written, this is needed for latin
languages. Whether or not, non-latin languages such as Chinese,
Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, Ukrainian, etc. need or not this
file is to be determined.

These file will be used for building the reduced font needed by Debian
Installer first stage process. This font needs to be as tiny as
possible but need to support all supported languages characters.
