# Creating floppy images requires mounting the image to copy files to it.
# This generally needs root permissions. To let a user mount the floppy
# image, add something like this to /etc/fstab:
#   /dir/debian-installer/build/dest/tmp-mnt.img /dir/debian-installer/build/mnt vfat noauto,user,loop 0 0
# Changing "/dir" to the full path to wherever debian-installer will be
# built. Then if you uncomment this next line, the Makefile will use
# commands that work with the above fstab line. Be careful: This lets any
# user mount the image file you list in fstab, and the user who can create
# that file could perhaps provide a maliciously constructed file that might
# crash the kernel or worse.. Note that this line points to the temporary
# image file to create, and MUST be an absolute path. Finally, when calling
# the floppy_image target, you must *not* use fakeroot, or syslinux will
# fail.
#USER_MOUNT_HACK=$(shell pwd)/$(DEST)/tmp-mnt.img

# What device to write floppies on
