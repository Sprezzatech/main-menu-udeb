# These udebs are needed on a single-floppy system that currently serves two
# purposes:
# 1. load the rest of the installer modules from driver floppies
# 2. get up on the network with just this single floppy (for common network
#    setups)
# If space becomes tight again, #2 will be relegated to a third floppy..

#include "base"
# Note, no kernel.
