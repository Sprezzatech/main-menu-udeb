* We're getting two copies of libdebconf, one in /lib, one in /usr/lib.
  This wastes some 40k!
* The dependancies between targets in the Makefile really need a lot of
  work.
* The apt-get autoclean call isn't good enough; sometimes the cache still
  contains multiple versions of a udeb, which breaks the makefile.
