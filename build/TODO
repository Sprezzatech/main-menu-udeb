* The apt download fails if the dpkg status file of the build system is
  in an inconsistent state. It could be overridden to use another status
  file, but that fail would have to claim that all dependancies of the
  udebs it's downloading were met. Hmm.
* If I want to have a local copy of kernel-image-di apt won't let me.  Apt
  looks and sees that I want nic-modules-2.4.1 and grabs the kernel for me
  without looking in the localudebs dir.  It would be nice if apt looked there.
* The dependancies between targets in the Makefile really need a lot of
  work.
