* The apt download fails if the dpkg status file of the build system is
  in an inconsistent state. It could be overridden to use another status
  file, but that fail would have to claim that all dependancies of the
  udebs it's downloading were met. Hmm.
* The dependancies between targets in the Makefile really need a lot of
  work.
* The apt-get autoclean call isn't good enough; sometimes the cache still
  contains multiple versions of a udeb, which breaks the makefile.
