* To save a little room, the status file could be reduced
  to only contain those fields that udpkg knows about.
* A post-dpkg-run dependancy check would be nice, to ensure that all
  dependancies are met, since we ignore them during the actual unpack
  phase.
* libc6 and any other libraries library reduction supplies 
  need to be put inside the tree's dpkg status file. They are not
  supplied as udebs, so that does not happen right now.
   - Build udebs on the fly?
   - Hack it?
* kernel and kernel modules stuff
* build bootable images
