* The busybox in the bootfloppy can be linked with uclibc and/or statically
  to make it smaller. Only the linuxrc uses it, so it doesn't really
  matter. This could save up to 200k on the boot floppy. But first someone
  needs to add code to install uclibc or a uclibc udeb.
* Find something to do with spare space on the bootfloppy; put udebs there
  for extra drivers or something.
* The apt download fails if the dpkg status file of the build system is
  in an inconsistent state. It could be overridden to use another status
  file, but that file would have to claim that all dependancies of the
  udebs it's downloading were met. Hmm.
* The debian/ directory is a bit of a mess because of the stillborn
  autobuilder stuff that is not going to happen.
* The extra driver disks stuff is currently hardcoded for one disk, and
  should be generalised and generally cleaned up.
* The size calcs in make stats for driver1 are not right, it can be full
  and will show as having space free.
* Add a terminfo-udeb and remove the workaround from Makefile.
