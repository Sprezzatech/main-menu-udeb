* DNS doesn't work
* We need the libresolv and libnss_dns libraries to be put onto the system.
  They are not since there are not string library deps on them, so it will
  need to be special cased in probably. 
* The dependancies between targets in the Makefile really need a lot of
  work.
* The apt-get autoclean call isn't good enough; sometimes the cache still
  contains multiple versions of a udeb, which breaks the makefile.
