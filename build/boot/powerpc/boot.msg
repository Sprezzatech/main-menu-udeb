Welcome to Debian GNU/Linux PowerPC (CODENAME)

Additionally to the default 'install' option, 
there is 'install-safe' which you should try if 
the system fails to boot at all (the typical
symptom is a white screen which doesn't go away).

************************************
If in doubt, just choose 'install', and if that doesn't work, try
'install-safe'.
