0fGETTING HELP07

If you can't install Debian, don't despair! The Debian team is ready to
help you! We are especially interested in hearing about installation
problems, because in general they don't happen to only 0fone07 person.
We've either already heard about your particular problem and can dispense a
quick fix, or we would like to hear about it and work through it with you,
and the next user who comes up with the same problem will profit from your
experience!

Problems with installation can be emailed to the Debian Boot team at
0fdebian-boot@lists.debian.org07. Or join us on irc, on the
0firc.debian.org07 server, channel 0f#debian-boot07.

Be sure to include a detailed explanation of your problem, including
a description of the hardware you are using, and the text of any system
error messages that you think might be relevant to the problem.



Press <09ENTER07> or type boot method, parameters, and <09ENTER07> to boot.
Press function key <09F107> for the help index.
