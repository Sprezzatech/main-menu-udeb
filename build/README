The files in this directory are used to build the Debian installer.
An overview of how the installer is built:

* sources.list is used to configure apt to download udebs from a mirror.
  You can change it to use whatever debian archive is convenient for you.
* lists/base contains udebs that are put on all systems; the other files
  in that directory define different types of debian installer systems
  by listing the udebs that they are composed of.
* The Makefile has a TYPE variable that selects one of the lists. Eg, 
  "make TYPE=net"
* apt is used to download the required udebs
* dpkg is used to unpack the udebs into builddir
* a customized set of reduced libraries is generated to correspond to the
  udebs that were installed
