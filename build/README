The files in this directory are used to build the Debian installer.
Basically it consists of downloading udebs, unpacking them, applying some
magic (library reduction etc.) and building an image.

Recipe:
 - Install the build-dependencies on the host system
   (run dpkg-checkbuilddeps).
 - Run "make sources.list" to automatically create a d-i sources.list.
   Or, create your own sources.list.local.
 - Run "fakeroot make image"

A more detailed overview of how the installer is built:

* 'sources.list' is used to configure apt to download udebs from a mirror.
  It is autogenerated based on '/etc//apt/sources.list', by the Makefile's
  'sources.list' target. Or you can provide your own locally modified
  'sources.list.local'.
* The Makefile is configured via the make fragments in the config
  directory. There are per-arch and per-image fragments that are included
  by the main Makefile. There is also a 'make/' subdirectory, with
  architecture-specific fragments that are included into the Makefile for
  non-configuration items.
* config/local can be added to override anything set in other fragments
  which are local to your system which you want to avoid accidentially
  committing.
* 'pkg-lists' has subdirectories for the different image types that list
  udebs that are put on each image. The pkg-lists/TYPE/common files list
  udebs common to all architectures, and the files named by architecture list
  udebs specific to an architecture. These files can have #include lines to
  include files from pkg-lists. Also, ${kernel:Version} in these files is
  replaced with the kernel version, as set in the KERNELIMAGEVERSION variable
  (plus the KERNEL_FLAVOUR variable).
* There's a TYPE variable that selects the type of image to build. Eg, 
  "fakeroot make TYPE=net" ("make listtypes" will list all available image
  types)
* Apt is used to download the required udebs. This does *not* include
  libraries; libraries used by udebs must be installed on the build system,
  and so are build-depended on.
* If you have some udebs that are not available on your mirror yet,
  you can drop them in 'localudebs/' and they will be used.
* dpkg is used to unpack the udebs into the build directory.
* A customized set of reduced libraries is generated to correspond to the
  udebs that were installed.
* Some boot images have associated "driver" disks. These disks just get
  udebs put on them. They are also unpacked and library reduction is run
  against them when doing library reduction for their parent image.
* "make demo" (run as root) will chroot into the system.
* To burn a demo CD image (ISO) with the created installation system,
  add the "image" argument to the the make call above. The resulting
  filesystem images will be placed in dest/.
