The files in this directory are used to build the Debian installer.
An overview of how the installer is built:

* mklibs.sh is used for library reduction. It will eventually be in its own
  package, but for now you must copy it into this directory from the
  boot-floppies cvs tree.
* sources.list is used to configure apt to download udebs from a mirror.
  You can change it to use whatever debian archive is convenient for you.
* lists/base contains udebs that are put on all systems; the other files
  in that directory define different types of debian installer systems
  by listing the udebs that they are composed of. Note that
  ${kernel:Version} in these files is replaced with the kernel version, as
  set in the KVERS variable in the Makefile.
* The Makefile has a TYPE variable that selects one of the lists. Eg, 
  "fakeroot make TYPE=net"
* Apt is used to download the required udebs.
* If you have some udebs that are not available on your mirror yet,
  you can drop them in localudebs/ and they will be used.
* Dpkg is used to unpack the udebs into the build directory.
* A customized set of reduced libraries is generated to correspond to the
  udebs that were installed.
* "make demo" (run as root) will chroot into the system.
