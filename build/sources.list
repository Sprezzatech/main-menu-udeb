# This is slightly different from a normal sources.list,
# since it retreives not only from the regular places, but from 
# from the debian-installer directory too.

# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE! (And accidentially check local edits into CVS..)
# Instead, copy it to sources.list.local, and make any local modifications
# there.

# Do NOT use file:// URI's in this file. If you have a local mirror,
# you must use copy:// instead.
