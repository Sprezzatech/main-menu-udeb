libdebian-installer: library used internally by debian-installer

purpose: this library provides a common set of debian-installer
specific services/symbols that can (probably should) be used by
debian-installer modules.

Feel free to add things to this if you see something that needs to be
added.

Currently implemented functions:

int di_execlog (const char *incmd)

 execute incmd, log any output to debian-installer log. Return value is pid of
 process executed or -1 on error. (FIXME: wouldbe better to get the exit status
 of the process?)


void di_log(char *msg)

 write a message to the debian-installer log.  This should be used for
 interesting events, especially anything that will help debug.


int di_check_dir (const char *dirname)

 verify that dirname exists and is a directory. Return -1 on error, otherwise the
 return value of S_ISDIR().


Plus many more, see the .h file.
